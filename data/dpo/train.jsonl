I tried to address it with him today, but my voice cracked and I got emotional. I'm terrified this makes me look unprofessional and that I'll be let go.", "chosen": "Thank you for sharing this with me. What you're describing sounds incredibly difficult and painful. First, I want to validate what you're feeling: the stress of a critical manager, the fear of job loss, and the frustration of becoming emotional during a conversation you hoped to handle calmly are all completely understandable reactions. Many people in their first professional roles have experienced similar moments of overwhelm—you are not alone in this.\n\nIt’s important to recognize that becoming emotional does not make you unprofessional. It makes you human. Showing emotion in a high-stress situation is a natural response, not a character flaw. The fact that you gathered the courage to address the issue directly with your manager speaks to your professionalism and commitment.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, let's consider some next steps. First, prioritize your well-being. The breakdown in the stairwell is a signal that your stress levels are unsustainable. Please be kind to yourself this evening. In the coming days, you might consider requesting a follow-up meeting with your manager. You could frame it by saying, \"I'd like to continue our conversation from yesterday. I value my role here and want to ensure I'm meeting expectations.\" This reframes the interaction around your performance and goals, rather than the emotional moment.\n\nIf the criticism feels excessive or personally targeted, please document specific instances. This is for your own clarity. Also, explore if your company has an HR department or an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) that offers confidential counseling—this is exactly the type of situation they can help you navigate.\n\nYour feelings of fear are real, but remember that one emotional moment is rarely grounds for termination, especially when you are proactively seeking solutions. Your well-being is paramount. If these feelings of anxiety persist or intensify, I strongly encourage you to seek support from a mental health professional who can provide ongoing guidance tailored to you. You took a brave step by reaching out here, and that same strength will help you navigate this challenge.", "rejected": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this.

It's great that you tried to address the issue with your manager today, even if it didn't go as smoothly as you'd hoped.\n\nAs for the concern about appearing unprofessional, it's not about how you handled your emotions, but rather about how you respond to them. Your manager should be understanding and empathetic, especially if you're open and honest about your concerns.\n\nHere are some suggestions to help you move forward:\n\n1.  **Take care of yourself**: Make sure you're taking breaks, eating well, and getting enough sleep. This will help you manage stress and maintain your composure in challenging situations.\n2.  **Reframe your mindset**: Instead of worrying about what others think, focus on your own strengths and accomplishments.

A strong therapeutic relationship is the foundation for this work. Given the depth of the issues you've outlined, which touch on trauma, addiction, and behavioral patterns, it is crucial that you feel your counselor is a capable guide. If you feel stuck, the most constructive and ethical next step would be to address this directly with your counselor. I encourage you to share these exact feelings in your next session. You could say something like, \"I value our work, but I'm feeling a need for more structured feedback or direction on my compulsive behaviors.\" This gives your counselor a chance to adjust their approach.\n\nIf, after an open conversation, you still feel unsupported, it may be appropriate to seek a consultation with another professional, perhaps one who specializes in trauma-informed care, eating disorders, and addiction.

What you are alleging—professional misconduct, potential medical malpractice, and intentional interference with parental rights—are serious matters that have specific legal and regulatory recourse.\n\nOn a practical level, I strongly encourage you to take the following steps, ideally with the support of your own attorney. First, immediately document everything: dates, times, names, medication details, and the specific allegations you believe were fabricated. Second, report the therapist to their state licensing board. This is a critical step to trigger an investigation into their professional conduct. Third, consult with a family law attorney regarding the custody and visitation issues, as the court needs to be informed of this potential manipulation. You may also need to consult with a civil attorney regarding potential lawsuits for malpractice or intentional infliction of emotional distress.

Please know that your feelings are completely understandable and you are not alone in this.\n\nWhat you're describing—the daily strain of new parenthood—can feel all-consuming. It's important to remember that caring for yourself is not a luxury; it's a necessity for being able to care for your little one. Let's explore a few practical strategies that many new parents find helpful.\n\nFirst, try to focus on **micro-moments of restoration**. Even 60 seconds of focused, deep breathing while the baby is safe in their crib can help regulate your nervous system. Second, **lower your standards** on non-essential tasks. The dishes can wait; if you have a moment of quiet, prioritize sitting down over cleaning. Third, **practice \"tag-team\" parenting** with your partner, if applicable. Schedule brief, predictable breaks where one of you is completely \"off duty,\" even if it's just for a 20-minute walk or a cup of tea in solitude. Fourth, **identify one or two people you can be honest with** about the struggle, beyond just the joys. Social connection is a powerful buffer against stress.\n\nI also want to gently mention that persistent exhaustion and stress can sometimes overlap with postpartum mood and anxiety disorders. If your stress ever feels unmanageable, if you have intrusive worries, or if you feel a deep sense of sadness or detachment, I encourage you to speak with your doctor or a mental health professional. This is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\nYou are navigating one of life's most demanding roles. Be as compassionate with yourself as you are with your new baby.

Starting a daily mindfulness practice. For example: listening to guided meditation; engaging in deep breathing exercises; yoga practice; or other positive calming activities.2.

I would try to reach out to a counselor to discuss this grief process at a deeper level to discern whether her death is part of why you feel this way. Grief and loss can also have an effect on your self-esteem. Can you begin to see how this cycle is what you may be experiencing? One positive I see is that you are continuing to look for a new job! Take time to give yourself some credit for the time you are spending looking for work. Also, I would recommend you set some short-term goals first for example, make a list of 5-10 potential new employers and send them each your resume. Then followup the next week with an email or phone call to make sure the hiring manager or human resources received your resume and have any questions. It is also a good idea to ask for \"informational interviews\" in order to get your foot in the door, so to speak.I hope that this information is helpful to you!

I only have two people in my life - my best friend and my wife. My mother forced my father out of my life so I do not know who he really is. We've gotten in contact but he just makes comments on how much I look like her when in fact I look more like him. This makes me mad because I don't want to look like my mother. I hate her.

Please help me. I need your advice.", "chosen": "Hello. It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight, and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage. I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now. Marriages take lots of work, and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young - good, bad, or indifferent. There are no easy answers to your questions, and I won't presume that my response to you will be the linch-pin that heals all your pain. But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections. First and foremost, cut yourself some slack. No one is perfect. We fail more often than we succeed, but in the end we learn, and that learning helps us grow. Yes, you're right, the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good, and need to stop. You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard, and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor. Seeing a therapist for yourself, and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach. You have issues that you need to resolve, that, while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life, they are separate from your marriage in many respects.Joining a marriage support group can also be helpful. You can find these through local counseling resources. Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful. If you belong to a religious or spiritual community, then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate. Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed, so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for you.Lastly, parents are imperfect. Yep...its true. They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage. We limp along and do our best. Having said that, we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future, no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us. The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid, and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life. Both with ourselves, and toward other people. So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions. It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit. I am sure that remains to be seen, but either way you both must be involved in saving it. If only one of you cares, then 100% of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person. That's not fair. So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants, and work to create an amicable solution. All of this said, seek out supportive friends, and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life.

If you have noticed that this happens frequently, there are some ways you can definitely help yourself going forward:1. Attend therapy to learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood. It's important to stay within the therapy until you feel you have mastered these tools. 2. Push yourself to interact more with your social groups and other positive activities. It's easy to go out and spend the day outside in the summer months, when the temperature is warm and the sun shines for long periods of the day, but it seems harder to find fun ways to spend your time when the temperature drops and darkness comes on so quickly. Perhaps winter time could become the time of year where you and your friends have weekly board game nights, complete with hot chocolate and a fire?3. You may want to consider the purchase of a S.A.D.

What are some effective ways to manage this constant pressure?", "chosen": "Thank you for reaching out and sharing what you're experiencing. It takes courage to acknowledge feeling overwhelmed, and I want you to know that your feelings are completely valid. Many people find themselves in a similar place, especially when the demands of life seem to pile up all at once. That constant pressure can be exhausting, both mentally and physically.\n\nAs a first step, I often encourage clients to practice a simple but powerful technique called \"grounding.\" When you feel the pressure mounting, pause for just 60 seconds. Take a few slow, deep breaths, and then name five things you can see, four things you can feel, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This can help bring you back to the present moment and temporarily slow the feeling of being swamped.\n\nNext, let's look at that \"plate.\" When everything feels like a top priority, it can be helpful to externalize it. I suggest taking 15 minutes to write down every single task, obligation, and worry. Then, categorize them: What is truly urgent (needs attention in the next 48 hours)? What is important but can be scheduled for later? And what can be delegated, simplified, or even let go of? This act of \"brain dumping\" and organizing can make things feel more manageable.\n\nIt's also crucial to remember that managing stress is not just about tackling tasks; it's about caring for your foundation. Prioritizing even small acts of self-care—like a short walk, staying hydrated, or ensuring you get enough sleep—is not a luxury; it's essential for resilience.\n\nIf these feelings of being overwhelmed persist, intensify, or begin to significantly impact your sleep, appetite, or mood, I strongly encourage you to consider speaking with a counselor or therapist in your area. They can provide you with ongoing, personalized support and strategies. You don't have to navigate this pressure alone.

Managing multiple tasks, responsibilities, and stressors can be overwhelming, but don't worry, I'm here to help.

This will help you tackle them one by one, making them feel less daunting and more manageable. Make a to-do list and check off tasks as you complete them.\n\n2. **Use a planner or calendar**: Write down all your tasks, deadlines, and appointments on a planner or calendar.

{"id": "counsel_00068", "prompt": "My depression has been reoccurring for a long time. It all started when I was being bullied in high school. In ninth grade, my principal told me I needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates. I needed professional help for my stress because I was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates. After that, I was fine for a couple of years. I entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work. I believe my depression re-booted from there with the stress. I began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her. Obviously, that wasn't the right choice. I regret ever doing that, seeing as even though I'm not self-harming anymore, I always look back at that time whenever I feel very stressed. I have a big problem with handling problems in life. Whenever a problem arises, I get stressed and I feel hopeless, as if it's not going to get better. I get way too stressed from my problems, which leads to overreacting a lot (especially when talking to others), which then leads to depression. I have a hard time coping with stress because I know that if I could handle it easily then I wouldn't be sad all the time, and I would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones.", "chosen": "I couldn't help but notice that you did not specify your age, so I am unable to set the total chronological order and length that you have suffered in this way, but I want to start by commending you on seeking out additional coping techniques on your own.

From what you have written, stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage. Often, when I am working with those who offer the same concern, there is a degree of people pleasing that comes with that stress. When we are trying to make others happy, especially when we are unable to distinguish the proper \"rules for success\", it can make even the simplest of tasks overwhelming. Stress management is just that, management; of our own anxieties about the needs of others, about our skills and the ability to complete a task and having multiple requests at any given time. Each of these aspects requires a separate sets of \"tools\" to manage them accordingly. For example, assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities, but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties. Try to separate the different areas of the problem, in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time. Perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your less-helpful responses to stress. For example, does a certain person's style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first? Is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity? Is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirements?Try to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you.", "rejected": "I'm so sorry to hear about your experiences with depression and the challenges you've faced.

Please know that your feelings are valid, and you are not alone in this struggle.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge that coping with this stress is not about achieving a perfect balance, which is often a myth, but about finding sustainable rhythms.

It worsens at night. It gets to the point I'm scared in my own home more so than anything. I have no access to the help I need so I'm desperate.", "chosen": "That really sucks and I'm sorry that's happening to you.I'm curious what kind of paranoia you are experiencing--like someone will hurt you? That something bad in general will happen? Sometimes intrusive thoughts, like paranoid thoughts, are just thoughts. They don't mean you are actually in danger or that something bad will happen, so pay attention to the meaning you apply to those thoughts. If you've been through something traumatic such as rape, domestic violence, or any situation like that, it could provoke paranoia bigtime. Your brain feels as if it has to be \"hypervigilant\", meaning it has to be extra attuned to everything around you to keep you safe. That's exhausting. If it's worse at night that probably means you aren't getting much sleep--also exhausting and contributes to heightened paranoia, so it becomes a pretty vicious cycle.It's not shocking that it's worse at night because night is generally a scarier time and sleeping is, physically, when we are in our most vulnerable state. It can help to take a look at how much of that paranoia is actually helping you to protect yourself vs. how much is additional stress. A way to figure that out is to ask the question, what behaviors are necessary to keep you safe? So if you lock your doors, lock the windows, shut the curtains, have an escape plan (if needed--I'm not sure what your situation is), is that the most you can do? Beyond that, are you performing other behaviors that may not be keeping you safe but exist to cope with the paranoia? For example, if you are checking over and over to make sure the doors and windows are locked, those behaviors are more like compulsions/rituals that help you feel safe by reducing anxiety even though they use a ton of energy to perform. Response prevention can be helpful here--this method involves avoiding your usual response so that you can sit with the anxiety rather than escaping it through the behaviors. Let's say your anxiety rises and you feel the need to check the door lock. You check the lock, it's for sure locked, and your anxiety is reduced. At the same time, the behavior of checking the lock is reinforced by feeling better, so your brain decides if you want to feel better, you need to check the lock. It becomes an exhausting habit that only temporarily makes you feel safe. However, if you feel a bout of anxiety and sit through it without checking the lock, your anxiety will go back down and your brain learns that you don't need to perform that behavior over and over.

In fact, other people are far more preoccupied with who might be judging them than whatever's going on with you.

It makes me wonder if I've done something to upset them or if they just don't enjoy talking to me. How can I encourage more engagement in our conversations?", "chosen": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It's completely understandable to feel hurt and confused when your messages seem to go unanswered, especially by friends. That sense of being ignored can be very painful, and it's natural to start questioning your relationships or your own actions. Please know that your feelings are valid, and many people have experienced this in our digital age where communication cues can be so ambiguous.\n\nWhile I can offer some general guidance, it's important to remember that as an online counselor, I don't have the full context of your relationships. If these feelings are causing significant distress or impacting your self-worth, connecting with a local therapist for ongoing support could be very beneficial.\n\nLet's explore some practical steps. First, consider the medium and timing. A busy group chat can easily bury messages, and a DM might be seen during a hectic moment with the intent to reply later, only to be forgotten. You might try gently changing your approach. Instead of an open-ended message, you could ask a specific, low-pressure question like, \"I'd love your thoughts on this when you have a moment,\" or suggest a concrete plan. Also, try shifting some interactions to voice or video calls, or in-person meetups when possible. These often foster more direct engagement.\n\nPay attention to patterns. Is this happening with all friends, or one specific group? If it's a consistent issue with certain individuals, it might be worth having a gentle, non-accusatory one-on-one conversation. You could say, \"I've noticed I'm not getting many replies lately. Is everything okay between us?\" This focuses on your feelings rather than blaming them.\n\nFinally, please be kind to yourself. A lack of response is often more about others' busy lives, communication styles, or the overwhelming nature of digital communication than it is about you or your worth as a friend. Nurture connections with those who reciprocate your effort, and consider investing your energy there.

During the day I manage, but when I'm alone in the evening, the quiet brings back all the happy times we shared, and I'm overwhelmed with sobbing. I feel like I should be 'over it' by now, so why do these crying spells still hit me so hard at night?", "chosen": "Thank you for sharing this with me. First, I want to acknowledge the profound loss you've experienced and the courage it takes to voice this ongoing pain. What you're describing—managing during the day but being overwhelmed by grief in the evening quiet—is a very common and understandable experience. Grief doesn't follow a linear timeline, and there is no \"should\" about when to be \"over it.\" The love you had for your father and best friend is enduring, so it makes sense that the pain of their absence is enduring too. These nighttime crying spells are not a sign of weakness or failure; they are a testament to the depth of your connection to them.\n\nIt's important to recognize that nighttime often removes the distractions of the day, allowing feelings we've held at bay to surface. This can feel like a sudden flood, but it is your heart and mind processing this significant loss in their own time.\n\nFor practical guidance, you might consider gently structuring your evening to create a sense of soft transition. This could involve a brief ritual, like lighting a candle and spending 15 minutes intentionally remembering them, writing in a journal, or listening to calming music. The goal isn't to avoid the feelings, but to create a container for them so they feel less overwhelming. Also, please consider if speaking with a grief counselor or therapist could provide you with a dedicated space to navigate this. They can offer tailored strategies for these intense moments.\n\nYour feelings are valid and important.

This can be a time when you're more aware of your feelings and more willing to acknowledge and process them.\n2.  **Lack of distractions**: During the day, you may be busy with work, socializing, or other activities that distract you from your emotions. At night, when you're alone, you may have more time to reflect on your feelings and memories, leading to a greater emotional impact.\n3.  **Sleep and memory consolidation**: Research suggests that sleep plays a role in memory consolidation, especially emotional memories.

She is in denial and is trying to hide the truth, to protect herself. This is a natural behaviour. You don't indicate whether she wants the marriage, or is planning to leave. Which way you go from here depends in part on the answer to that question. If she wants the marriage, you certainly have the right to say \"I need answers to all my questions\". Giving you the information she needs has to be (if she wants the marriage) more important than protecting herself. I would support your right to advocate for all the information you need in order to feel secure or make decisions. She may fear that the truth will turn you away. If you want to, you can reassure her that you want the marriage no matter what the truth is. If the marriage is to survive, it needs openness.If, on the other hand, she's planning to end the marriage, then you might want to resign yourself to the fact that you may never get the information you seek. You are better off, in that case, seeking support from friends and family rather than beating on a closed door. Your wife has some decisions to make. Try to give her a bit of time to make them.

Think about what you want from the relationship and what you're willing to accept.\n\n2.  **Have an open and calm conversation:** Choose a good time to have an open and calm conversation with your partner.

For example, you might say, \"I feel hurt when you don't tell me the truth about your infidelity.\"\n\n3.  **Communicate your boundaries:** Clearly communicate your boundaries and expectations in the relationship.

First, I want to acknowledge how painful and disorienting this experience must be for you. It is completely understandable to feel a deep sense of worry, confusion, and hurt when a long-term relationship ends so abruptly, especially under these concerning circumstances. Your care for your partner, even now, speaks volumes.\n\nYou are asking a very insightful question about how addiction alters thinking and decisions. In essence, active addiction can profoundly impact a person's prefrontal cortex—the part of the brain responsible for judgment, decision-making, and impulse control. The drive to obtain and use the substance can become the primary motivator, often overriding values, promises, and important relationships. This can manifest as erratic behavior, dishonesty, and seemingly self-destructive choices, as the addiction seeks to protect itself. It is important to remember that while this explains the behavior, it does not excuse the hurt it has caused you.\n\nYour primary concern right now needs to be your own well-being. The most actionable step you can take is to seek support for yourself. I strongly encourage you to connect with a therapist or a support group like Al-Anon or Nar-Anon. These resources are specifically for people affected by a loved one's addiction and can provide you with crucial coping strategies, clarity, and a supportive community. They can help you navigate the complex feelings of grief and worry while establishing healthy boundaries.\n\nRegarding safety: if you have a genuine, immediate concern that your ex-partner is in danger of overdose or self-harm, you may consider contacting a crisis line or, if appropriate, a trusted member of their family.

Each time we have a break-up we are a bit more in touch with how much is at stake in this whole love and relationship business. We are falling in love and letting someone close to our hearts and there's a vulnerability in that; we can get hurt. Who you partner with long-term is a big decision and it determines 90% of our happiness in life. The good news is that when we're just starting to get to know someone, we can take it slow. I think maybe you are slowing yourself down instinctively here, and that's okay. We are naturally people of attachment and it won't likely last if you are normally an open and accessible person who doesn't put up walls. So part of what I want to say here is don't pressure yourself too much. Take the time to heal naturally and listen to your instinct that is telling you to take things slow. :)As well, there are a few things you can do to make sure that the walls do eventually come down, or will come down for the right person. First, think about the lessons you learned from this past relationship. What do you feel proud of? What do you need in a partner? What mistakes did you make? Use this experience to grow in your awareness of how you work in a relationship and what you need from a partner.Look at your thoughts. Are you having generalized negative thoughts like \"No one will ever love me again?\", or \"I'm going to get hurt again\", or \"I can't trust myself\"? If so, write down what these thoughts are, and then ask yourself what evidence supports these thoughts. Fear tries to convince us that there is either something wrong with us or that something bad will happen, but it does so with little or no evidence of this ever happening!! It sells us a line based on no concrete evidence. Then ask yourself what evidence supports the opposite thought. What is the evidence that I am lovable... that there are safe, good people out there... that I can trust myself? Eliminate the negative thoughts, and add the positive ones. It's simple but very powerful.Lastly, take concrete and careful steps to act as though there are no walls. What is the evidence of the walls? Can you take purposeful baby steps in the direction of lowering those walls?

Your desire to be respectful while managing your own comfort is a sign of great sensitivity, and I want to validate that.\n\nAs a starting point, I encourage a gentle exploration of your own feelings.

Is it a fear of participating in an unfamiliar ritual, a concern about offending someone, or perhaps an internal conflict if practices differ from your own beliefs?

It takes a great deal of courage to bring forward a memory that has been buried and is now causing you distress. What you're describing—the feelings of awkwardness, confusion, and current distress—are completely valid and understandable reactions. Many people have experiences in their past, particularly from formative times like college, that they later re-examine with a more complex adult perspective.\n\nIt’s very common for individuals to engage in sexual exploration with friends during adolescence and young adulthood. The term \"experimenting\" is often used because, at the time, it may have felt like a way to explore curiosity and sexuality in a safe, known context.

Waking up multiple times throughout the night is incredibly frustrating and exhausting, and it can really take a toll on your mood, energy, and overall well-being. Please know that your experience is valid, and it's very common for people to struggle with fragmented sleep, especially during times of stress or change.\n\nAs a counselor, I want to acknowledge that while I can offer guidance on managing the thoughts and anxieties that often accompany sleep issues, persistent sleep fragmentation can sometimes have underlying medical causes, such as sleep apnea, hormone imbalances, or chronic pain. Therefore, a crucial first step I often recommend is scheduling a check-up with your primary care physician or a sleep specialist. They can help rule out any physiological factors, which is important for your safety and for creating an effective treatment plan.\n\nIn tandem with that medical consultation, we can explore some practical strategies to improve your sleep hygiene and relationship with rest. A helpful approach is to focus on consistency: try to wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends, to regulate your body clock. When you do wake up at night, avoid looking at the clock, as this can increase anxiety. Instead of lying in bed feeling frustrated, practice the \"15-minute rule\": if you're awake for more than 15-20 minutes, get out of bed and do a quiet, non-stimulating activity in dim light (like reading a physical book) until you feel sleepy again. This helps reassociate your bed with sleep rather than wakefulness.\n\nLastly, let's be compassionate with yourself. The pressure to \"get perfect sleep\" can itself be disruptive.

{"id": "counsel_00456", "prompt": "My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didn't like this. For our New Year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on board—no more drinking every night. The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not.

His behaviour is passive aggressive and immature, which puts you into this position of having to act like a disapproving parent. It sounds more like you're talking about an out-of-control teenager than your partner. Your husband's lying is sending a message. \"I get to make my own decisions and you can't stop me\" might be it. Underneath that, maybe it's \"I want to stop but I'm ashamed that I can't and I don't want you to see my failures\". Ultimately, as an adult, he gets to decide what he puts in his mouth and if you try to manage that by monitoring how many beers he has, you are pretty certain to get some fallout... pushback...backlash... How does his drinking affect you? That's where your voice has power, rather than in counting his beers or setting him up to lie (when he's passed out, asking if he's been drinking seems confusing). You've mentioned snoring, which I guess is a legitimate complaint. If he's passing out, that's a legitimate complaint. When he drinks does he drive, act aggressively, or 'check out of' the relationship (avoid you)? All of these things are legitimate concerns, and I'd stick to talking about those rather than counting beers. My guess is he has few other ways to cope with stress, so he checks out with alcohol, and it also helps him avoid your relationship. But the problem is it makes it worse; the more he avoids you, then more you chase him with your questions.There's a conversation that would be helpful here. It sounds like \"I've tried to support you in your drinking less, and it's not working. What are your goals for alcohol and how can I support you in that more effectively?\" I'd like to see you in a place where you're not micromanaging his drinking, but focusing on the things that affect you. What concrete supportive methods can you use with his agreement? Can we get the alcohol out of the house? Is he willing to seek treatment? Lay your expectations out really clearly. \"I won't count your beers, but I can't tolerate lying\". You have to decide what's more important; is it really the number of beers, or is it something else. What do you need to happen in order to want to remain in the marriage? What does he need? Does he let you know what isn't okay with him? He might have trouble saying these things. The drinking is only a part of the complex dynamic in your marriage.

Your dad is your dad, and waiting for him to change won't really help. Nothing you do can change your dad, but...there are things you can do for yourself and your relationship with him.

The American Society of Addiction Medicine defines addiction as \"a treatable, chronic medical disease involving complex interactions among brain circuits, genetics, the environment, and an individual's life experiences. People with addiction use substances or engage in behaviors that become compulsive and often continue despite harmful consequences.\" Notice that nothing in the definition speaks about willpower or motivation. That's because addiction is a disease - just like diabetes or high blood pressure. Imagine I gave a huge piece of chocolate cake to a diabetic. After he eats the cake, I say to him \"Use your willpower to lower your glucose to 100.\" Do you think he would be successful? All addictions are behaviors. Behavior can be understood in terms of function and reinforcement. All behavior is either an attempt to get something or an attempt to get away from something. If you apply this logic to addictive behaviors, the use of mood-altering substances is an attempt to create a particular feeling or emotion, or an attempt to numb one. When a behavior is reinforced, we are more likely to engage in the same behavior again in the future. Let's assume that I'm feeling very anxious. I drink some alcohol and notice that my anxiety decreases. My brain takes note of this and the next time I'm feeling anxious I am more likely to reach for a bottle. Now, imagine this happening hundreds, if not thousands, of times. Addiction recovery is about identifying and treating the underlying reasons for the use. A qualified addiction therapist will assist you in developing a relapse prevention plan that addresses these underlying issues and helps you to identify triggers for your use. Additionally, you will learn how to avoid triggers and gain healthy coping skills to use instead of relying on alcohol. I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors.

If the abuse included verbal or psychological condemnation, you will often have a negative self-image that you may \"know\" is not true but often feels very true. This negative self-image and fear of being abused again can activate protections in you that were needed at the time you were abused but now create a \"wall\" in your current relationship. The fact that you were able to end the relationship and know that you made the right decision is a great acknowledgement that you have solid internal resources to draw upon in healing from the abuse. Good for you!Nightmares and flashbacks are a strong sign of memories, including associated beliefs, emotions, and physical sensations, that have remained unprocessed and therefore unhealed. There are likely reminders (called triggers) of the past abuse that are being activated in your current relationship that are allowing these unhealed memories to come to the surface and affect both your sleep and your waking experiences. This is certainly not something you are purposefully doing but is the result of what happened to you. However, you likely feel as if you are not in control. The goal is protect your current relationship, evaluate your self-image for flaws in beliefs and feelings, and begin working on healing your memories of abuse. In many cases, my use of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) would be helpful in reducing the emotional strength of your abuse memories, reduce or eliminate triggers, bring healing, and allow you to enjoy being in the present with your current relationship.

It takes courage to acknowledge when a dynamic within your friend group is causing you discomfort, especially when it seems like everyone else is on a different page. Your feelings are completely valid. It's understandable to feel uneasy and frustrated when constant sarcasm makes you feel like you can't engage in genuine, meaningful conversation. That longing for connection and seriousness is a very human need.\n\nWhat you're describing can be emotionally draining over time.

It's completely understandable to feel preoccupied and to seek a creative outlet, like the jewelry, to process those intense emotions.\n\nFirst, I want to gently highlight the importance of professional boundaries. Romantic feelings for a coworker, particularly within the same team, can create significant complications for your work environment, your emotional well-being, and potentially for others involved. The fact that you suspect she may be seeing another teammate adds another layer of complexity and potential for hurt. Purchasing a personal gift, while stemming from genuine emotion, could be misinterpreted and may inadvertently cross a professional line.\n\nLet's focus on some practical steps.

It may also be helpful to consciously limit one-on-one, non-essential interactions with this colleague to give yourself space for these feelings to settle.\n\nGiven the intensity of your distress, speaking with a counselor individually could be incredibly beneficial.

His persistent messages calling you names like \"dishonest\" and \"irresponsible\" are concerning, as this shifts from a discussion about a shared expense into personal criticism. You have a right to be treated with respect, even in a disagreement.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, it's crucial to separate the logistical issue from the interpersonal one. On the logistical side, reflecting on the original agreement is a start. While the trip was his idea, you did verbally agree to contribute. A possible path forward could be to offer a sincere apology for the unexpected change in your contribution, and then propose a concrete, reasonable plan to repay the $30 when you are feasibly able to. This isn't about admitting dishonesty, but about acknowledging the impact of the changed circumstance.\n\nHowever, the core issue here is the breakdown in communication and respect. His response appears disproportionate and is creating a hostile environment. Given that this involves a colleague, I strongly encourage you to prioritize setting clear boundaries. You might consider sending a brief, calm reply stating that you are willing to discuss a resolution when you are both back in the office and in a calmer state, but that you will not engage in further accusatory messaging.

These are tools to help regulate your nervous system.\n\nMost importantly, you should not have to navigate this alone. I strongly recommend connecting with support resources at your college. The counseling center is an excellent place to start.

Just reading through the details you put in the question, I hear a couple things. One is that you seem like a helper. That's not bad at all, though other people taking advantage of your nurturing qualities and not giving that back to yourself can really zap your energy. Seems like you were the one that had to take care of your ex for a very long time. Think about what that takes--a lot of patience, great emotional awareness, flexibility to adjust to needs and change plans, etc. What that also means is that you probably had to focus so heavily on him that you weren't able to give any of that attention to yourself. The great part is that it doesn't look a whole lot different when you give that to you vs someone else. Self-love and self-care is a really important piece of managing anxiety (and depression), as you learned with your ex.The other thing I noticed is that it sounds like you maybe tend to people-please. This is common with people that are helpers--they are almost a package deal. People-pleasing is really about abandonment. It's derived from a fear that if you aren't exactly what people need, they may have negative feelings toward you and ultimately abandon or reject you. May also stem from a need for peace if you grew up in a chaotic home (common with kiddos from domestic violence backgrounds), though that usually has some type of connection to abandonment as well.As far as anxiety management goes, there's so much you can do. It's hard to say what will work specifically for you, but first thing that might help is to understand your triggers. What gives you anxiety? Is it general and seems to come out of nowhere? Or does it buildup and get worse at a certain time of day? I find that many people who have unresolved grief and depression tend to cycle through those symptoms and anxiety because there's so much stress and pressure involved in the cluster of issues that those circumstances tend to bring. Sorting those things out can be tough---if you need help from a friend or counselor, it's never too late to reach out. It doesn't matter if it happened last week or 10 years ago.

First, I want to validate what you're feeling: yes, it is entirely normal for grief to surface with this kind of intensity, even after a decade. Grief doesn't follow a linear timeline, and the quiet, vulnerable moments at the end of the day are often when our minds and hearts finally allow the feelings we've managed during the day to come forward.

He has nothing to offer me.", "chosen": "Hi Attica,This is a question I think a lot of people deal with...they feel confusion about why they can't forget about or get over (or stop connecting with) someone who they absolutely know isn't good for them. In your case, part of the problem is that he keeps trying to get back in touch with you. For some people, honestly, it's a game... to see how much power they have over you or it's their need to control you. If you don't want contact from this person, it's really important to give him clear messages about boundaries (\"Don't contact me again\"), and then ignore all of their communications. Any interactions or responses from you at all will feed their behaviour. Remind yourself why you don't want to be with them. I hear you doing that already when you say \"he has nothing to offer me\". That's great self-talk.But let's get back to the question of why we have a hard time letting go of people like this. Sometimes it's because we still hope they will change. Maybe we remember who they used to be or how they used to treat us, and we think it can go back to the way it felt in those \"good old days\". The problem there is that, over the first few years, as intimacy grows, people tend to show more of who they are, not less. So what they're eventually showing you is who they are and what they're capable of. People do change and grow, but it won't happen at your pace. Accept that person for who they are and stop expecting them to change. Another reason we can't let go is because we picture our ex with someone new in the future and we wonder if they will be a better person for the next partner in their life. This is a normal... but not a healthy... thought. It's as though we want them to stay, maybe apologize, and heal our hurts; maybe make up for past mistakes. You deserve that healing, you deserve better than you got, you deserve apologies, but to expect that from the person who hurt you and hasn't demonstrated that compassion as yet is probably foolhardy. It is my belief that underlying some of the above scenarios is the deep belief that we must somehow be responsible for the hurts our exes have caused. If you blame yourself in any way for someone's poor treatment of you, you will be dancing around trying to do things differently so that they can treat you better. It will be impossible to let go, because you blame yourself for their behaviours.Draw a line.

It’s clear you are thoughtfully considering the well-being of your students and the ethical management of your caseload, which is a cornerstone of effective school counseling. Navigating when to conclude regular sessions can indeed be complex, balancing a student's progress with the ongoing needs of the broader school community.\n\nProfessionally, the decision to stop regular sessions is typically guided by several key factors. The primary indicator is whether the initially identified counseling goals have been met. This is something we collaboratively assess with the student, reviewing the progress made on the issues that brought them in. For instance, if a student was seen for academic motivation and they have now developed consistent study habits and their grades have stabilized, we might transition to occasional check-ins. Another sign is when the student demonstrates increased resilience and has successfully applied coping strategies independently over a period of time.\n\nIt's also crucial to consider the scope of our role. School counseling is often short-term and solution-focused. If a student's needs become more intensive, chronic, or extend beyond the school's scope (e.g., requiring clinical diagnosis or long-term therapy), a referral to an outside mental health provider is the most ethical step. In this case, we would not simply \"stop,\" but would facilitate a warm handoff and possibly provide follow-up support at school to ensure continuity.\n\nWe must always prioritize safety. If there are any ongoing concerns about risk to self or others, sessions would not be terminated abruptly. Instead, we would ensure a robust safety plan is in place and that external providers or supports are actively involved.\n\nUltimately, transparency with the student and, as appropriate, their guardians, is vital. We frame the transition not as an ending, but as a graduation to a new phase, always leaving the door open for future check-ins. You are doing right by your students by reflecting on this process so carefully.", "rejected": "In a school setting, a counselor may determine when to stop regular sessions with a student based on several factors, including:\n\n1. **Achievement of goals**: If the student has reached their goals, whether academic, personal, or both, the counselor may decide that the student no longer needs ongoing support.\n2. **Progress made**: If the student is not making progress towards their goals, the counselor may determine that ongoing support is no longer needed.\n3. **Change in circumstances**: If the student's circumstances have changed, such as a change in family circumstances or a move to a new school, the counselor may need to adjust the frequency or type of support provided.\n4. **Student's needs**: The student's needs may have changed over time, and the counselor may need to adjust the type or frequency of support to meet those changing needs.\n5. **School or program requirements**: The school or program may have specific requirements for the frequency or duration of counseling sessions, which may dictate when to stop regular sessions with a student.", "topic": "professional-ethics", "judge_reason": "Response A demonstrates superior empathy, professionalism, and safety awareness by validating the counselor's role, emphasizing collaborative goal assessment, ethical scope and referral, and safety planning, while Response B is a generic list lacking depth and nuance."}

I really want to stop it and enjoy things.", "chosen": "We all experience that to a different level, depending on who you ask. It's actually born out of a good quality---prosocialness. When we care what others think of us, we are also attuned to how we are treating them and what's socially right vs wrong. It definitely does feel like it's more about ourselves, however--meaning it feels like we worry about what others think because we don't want to be socially outcast or rejected. That's also (again, to a certain level) a healthy quality. It means you want connection. Connection is crucial to mental health and, according to some available research, physical health. No matter how mentally healthy or socially confident you are, if you care about connection, you're going to care about what people think of you to an extent. So the work here is to figure out what worry is warranted vs what is just causing you suffering. A good way to tell the difference here is to write it out in list form. Write out all the socially-anxious thoughts you have and scale them from \"needed\" or \"helpful\" to \"unnecessary\" or \"unhelpful\". Some may fall in the gray area here. For example: if you worry that others think you are inconsiderate, so you often say sorry---weed out what's actually inconsiderate vs what you feel is maybe inconsiderate because you feel like a burden to others. Getting in someone's personal space would warrant some worry and an apology. Asking for help when you need it is something you don't have to apologize for. Something else to consider here is there's probably some underlying shame. Shame is a cluster of really tough feelings and if it had a voice, it'd say things like, \"you're not good enough\", \"you aren't likeable\", \"you are annoying and no one wants to be around you\", etc. Those feelings typically create the worry you experience about others. Shame survives and is strengthened by the attention you give to it. The more you compete with it, the less powerful it becomes. Sometimes that comes in the form of noticing the wonderful qualities in yourself. Sometimes it takes practice putting yourself out there when it's really scary. No matter what, shame's nemesis is connection---to yourself and to others. That's how you prove it's wrong. Try not to take shame at face value!If you are struggling with using these techniques or just don't know if they are right for you, a counselor can help you out and give you a more individualized approach.

I have a feeling that a few things may be going on here. It is really hard to say since I don’t know you, how old you are, etc. But, I will share you with you some thoughts. Some people, when they have undesirable thoughts that really surprise them, have a really tough time getting rid of them.

It’s like telling you not to think of pink elephants. I would be willing to bet that you thought of a pink elephant just now. So, rather than fighting thoughts that you find confusing, sometimes it is helpful to allow yourself to explore the thought with curiosity and without judgement. Where is this thought coming from? What are my feelings about it? Asking yourself these questions may help you come to a resolution about what is going on. One possibility is that you have developed an anxiety about your thoughts and now you are in the process of obsessing about them, but another possibility is that you are legitimately exploring your sexuality and gender. I get the feeling from your question that you do not want to believe that it is second possibility. And that is okay.

This is one of those times when you wish you could assure someone that everything will go perfectly, but unfortunately I can't do that. There is no way of knowing how parents might respond until you tell them. The truth is that people have come out to their parents in many different ways. Some have told their parents directly, some drop hints, some have had others tell their parents, etc. The only \"right\" way to come out is the one that you choose. The one that feels right to you. That is the best way. Some people decide not to come out, and some wait for a very long time. Both of these things are okay.

The standard is often high, focusing on immediate risk, not just out-of-control behavior.\n\nMy most urgent guidance is to **prioritize your and your family's safety**.

You could say something like, \"I know we both miss Dad in our own ways, but right now, revisiting our past arguments is too painful for me. Can we focus on sharing a positive memory instead?\" Second, try to create small moments of self-compassion each day. This could be as simple as writing a letter to your father to express things left unsaid, or spending time in a place that brings you a sense of peace. Please remember that despair can sometimes cloud our perspective on the future. If you ever have thoughts of harming yourself, it is crucial to reach out immediately to a crisis line or go to the nearest emergency room.\n\nYou do not have to walk this path alone. Seeking support is a sign of strength, not weakness. I am holding space for your pain and your healing.", "rejected": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're struggling with feelings of despair and grief after the loss of your father.

It's as if the wound is reopened, making it hard to process and heal. This can be especially true when the relationship with the person who's passing away is complicated, or when the memories are bittersweet.\n\nHere are some suggestions that might help:\n\n1.  **Allow yourself to feel your emotions**: Acknowledge your feelings and give yourself permission to feel them. It's okay to be sad, angry, or any other emotion that arises. Avoid suppressing your emotions, as this can prolong the healing process.\n2.  **Practice self-care**: Take care of your physical and emotional well-being. Engage in activities that bring you comfort, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature. Make time for relaxation and rest to help your mind and body recover.\n3.  **Create a memory book**: Write down the happy memories of your father and the memories you cherish.

Together, brainstorm low-confrontation strategies he could use, such as simply not responding to that type of content, using a neutral reply like \"Hey, let's keep the chat work-related,\" or adjusting notification settings.

{"id": "counsel_00332", "prompt": "How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?", "chosen": "Previous counselors have discussed very good points about your situation so I would like just to confirm what seems essential to me on this topic. When you ask yourself this question, it shows you are not happy or have doubts about the way things have evolved so far. Relationships require time and work for them to develop, grow and flourish as healthy and fulfilling ones for both partners. This is a key factor, \"reciprocity\". Without both of you sharing the same core values, beliefs, expectations and lifestyles; without you having a good level of compatibility in your personalities and feeling understood, protected, cared by, supported and loved by each other, there is no way you could truly feel and experience a mutually healthy, meaningful and fulfilling relationship for the long run. What has attracted you to each other is good and meaningful enough to empower and support you for the long run? Many people focus too much on looks, financial benefits or other external factors, which are important but cannot build a healthy, mature and fulfilling lifelong relationship. This does not mean many couples do not willingly choose these types of relationship since truly believing those are their top priorities. What they ignore, is that with time, life challenges, issues and pain, temptations and appealing alternatives around those external factors, their relationships would not cope very well but would get gradually or suddenly undermined. Be honest with yourself, reflect on what you truly need, want, and expect from a boyfriend and life partner. Ask yourself if this person has what it takes to meet those expectations and satisfy those needs and if you are also a very good match for him, since there is no way the relationship works unless it does for both of you. So while one person could feel blessed by having such a wonderful partner, the other could feel frustrated, or just not truly fulfilled, passionate or happy with her/his partner. Long-term relationships require a lot, and when I talk about sharing same core factors, I mean truly feeling being a good match to each other at the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual levels, and around all the other roles life involves, related to lifestyle as social life, habits, dreams, preferences, etc.Then there is a lot to reflect on by yourself, to carefully evaluate in yourself based on what you already know about you and this person. Then you would be able to tell yourself if you truly want to continue or not with this person. If you feel you do, then you have to talk to him and make sure he feels the same way. In a scenario where you doubt if you should tell him about this or that, as another counselor suggested, out of fear of any form of abuse or retaliation, those would be serious enough to show you this could never truly work. If your fears are more about being misunderstood and judged, then you still have to work on developing open and honest communication with him, as long as what you expect is something truly healthy and worthy. Many people look for and stay in relationships because they prefer that to be alone, by themselves, thus they end using relationships to feel better about themselves and their lives, to bring some feelings of happiness and company. The problem, is that if those are the initial core reasons to start or stay in a relationship, this can never truly evolve into anything healthy and mutually fulfilling, unless the person works on herself/himself to meet those personal needs and resolve those personal issues, which would enable her to work on self and with the other person in the relationship. Finally, I want to mention what I shared in a past article on this subject; namely, you need to assess if your boyfriend has been really consistent in his words and actions, otherwise, lack of honesty, accountability and/or respect, would never lead to anything worthy in any type of relationships. Also, we are all human beings, and that means we are no perfect, and we need to work on ourselves to make improvements. Relationships are a means to keep growing as individuals supporting each other to become better versions of ourselves, without manipulation, neglect or abuse. Thus while on one hand, healthy love means embracing the whole persona with strengths and weaknesses, on the other hand, it is fully incompatible with tolerating and/or enabling what is distorted or dysfunctional against that person or against ourselves. This is why both persons need to be willing and ready to work on making changes and improvements as necessary. Without this, it would be hopeless and helpless to expect things would be just fine with time, they would not, they would just get worse. So let's take one step at a time, reflect on what you feel, need and want now and for the future, assess how well this person is able and willing to work on that, and dialogue to make sure you are both fully aware, understood and clear about your relationship and how well it could make your lives better. If professional support is needed, and both are willing to take it, please do not delay it. If one refuses necessary support, then face reality and come to terms with what it is showing you. Trust more actions than words, set and keep healthy boundaries, and take into account what life experiences show you, as well as feedback and counsel from those mature and truly caring people who know you while pushing away what is superficial, biased or too rushed.Thank you for sharing.", "rejected": "As a helpful assistant, I'll provide some guidance on how to make that difficult decision.

So maybe your list would include symptoms you've been struggling with, how you want to change, and what you need from them to help you change. If you do this and it doesn't turn out well, remember that it's on them and not you. Sometimes parents are doing the best they can, and sometimes it's not good enough. That never means you aren't worth helping. It could be helpful to make a backup plan for how you will try to reach out to someone if they don't respond well.You also don't specify your age, or if you are even a teen. I'm assuming you are, but if not, you may be able to get help without their consent or help. If you are closer to age 18, you may not have long to wait.

You might also consider reaching out to a mental health professional, such as a psychologist or a psychiatrist, who specializes in anxiety, depression, or trauma.\n2.  **Prepare what you want to say**: Think about what you want to say and how you want to say it. You might want to write down your thoughts and feelings before you talk to someone. This can help you feel more in control and prepared.\n3.  **Be honest and open**: Share your story in a way that feels comfortable for you.

The combination of an unmanaged psychiatric condition, physical violence, isolation, and now paranoid accusations creates a volatile environment where safety is the paramount concern. It is common for survivors to vacillate about leaving; the cycle of hope and fear is powerful and is often a tool of control used by the abuser.

Consider having a calm, clear conversation with your husband to ensure you are a united front against these divisive tactics.\n\nPlease prioritize your own emotional well-being.

{"id": "counsel_00366", "prompt": "My wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that I'm doing things she finds disrespectful even when I don't mean it like that. For example, she gets offended when I call someone at work \"sweetheart.\" I wish I had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her. She doesn't, and never will say she was wrong. How do I get her to understand?", "chosen": "Hello. That must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship, especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault. This could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the long-term. Based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wife's side of the story, I would say that you are raising 3 different concerns. One is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified. It may bear clarifying how each of you define \"infidelity\". Currently, there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hook-up, chatroom texting, extensive phone calls to a female friend, viewing pornography, a massage with happy ending, physical intercourse, or intimate emotional sharing. Depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured, you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities. If there is no truth to it, then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying, \"I feel you distancing from me.\" In other words, it's not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her. Often times, accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness. If so, what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally. If this is true, you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again. Otherwise, if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong, the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs. The second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a \"sweetheart.\" The term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean \"you're so sweet and kind\", \"my dear\", or in a flirtatious manner to mean \"sweetie.\" The intention behind the use is known only to the speaker. You may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife. If your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context, it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said. If she finds the term disrespectful, it may be her way of expressing, \"I want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that I am not valued as much.\" Therefore, arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark. Rather, the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings? You may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you? Is saying \"sweetheart\" to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife? That said, if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding, accomodating and prioritizing her needs, then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities. She may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fears.The last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting she's wrong. Indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong. In the absence of her admitting to any faults, it could seem like you are the one with the problem. Unfortunately, blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy. This pattern can also trigger the partners' insecurity as they witnesses the distancing, which could make them angrier and more accusatory - creating a vicious cycle. Finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment. This kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding. We sometimes take for granted the simple expression of, \"I'm sorry.\" However, it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that. In my practice, when a client tells me that his or her partner never says \"I'm sorry\", I am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability. If neither of them express it, then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesn't do it.? These insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation, which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientating.

It takes a great deal of courage to articulate these feelings, especially when they're accompanied by confusion and shame. First and foremost, I want to validate what you're experiencing. The feelings you describe—the strong pull, the enjoyment, and the subsequent confusion—are not uncommon. Many individuals explore aspects of gender expression that differ from societal expectations, and doing so in private is a very common starting point.\n\nIt’s important to separate a few key concepts here, which often get tangled up and cause distress. **Gender identity** (your internal sense of being a man), **sexual orientation** (being attracted to women), and **gender expression** (how you choose to present yourself through clothing, etc.) are distinct parts of a person. Enjoying feminine attire does not inherently change your identity as a straight, cisgender man. It can simply be a form of self-expression, a way to connect with a different facet of your personality, or a source of comfort and aesthetic pleasure.\n\nThe shame you mention is often the voice of internalized societal messages. A helpful first step is to practice self-compassion. When you engage in this private practice, try to notice the feeling without immediate judgment. Ask yourself, \"What does this experience provide for me? Comfort? Creativity? A sense of freedom?\" Journaling about these feelings can help you understand their role in your life without shame.\n\nGiven the depth of your confusion, I would gently suggest exploring this with a professional. A therapist, particularly one knowledgeable in LGBTQ+ affirmative therapy or gender identity issues, can provide a confidential, non-judgmental space to unpack these feelings more fully.

Each year near the date, they become withdrawn and talk about needing space, even suggesting we separate, though we usually recover.

It is completely understandable to feel a desperate desire to \"fix\" this and to hold your marriage together, even amidst such complex hurt.\n\nFirst, I want to validate that the loss of your daughter is a trauma that both of you carry, and grief has no timeline. It is common for partners to grieve differently, which can create a painful sense of distance. Your partner's withdrawal and the extreme suggestions of separation around the anniversary are likely expressions of an overwhelming, reactivated pain—a way of pushing away the source of a shared hurt when the hurt itself feels unmanageable.\n\nYour willingness to forgive is a testament to your strength, but I am gently concerned that \"fixing\" this may be beyond what the two of you can do alone at this point. The introduction of a third party, the coworker, significantly complicates the grief process and adds a layer of relational injury. While the coworker may provide a listening ear, it has created a dynamic that often deepens the marital rift.\n\nThe most actionable and crucial step I can recommend is to seek professional support, both individually and as a couple. A therapist specializing in grief and trauma can provide a safe, neutral space. For you, it can help process your own grief and the secondary trauma of your partner's cycles. For your partner, it can offer the compassionate listening they seek, but within a healthy boundary. For your marriage, it can help you both learn to reconnect with and listen to each other's unique grief, rebuilding trust.

When faced with these kinds of difficult challenges, I usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be. Indeed, it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we don't feel very content with our lives. Perhaps you can take some time to think through a couple of these questions: What kind of person do I want to be deep in my heart? What kind of character do I want to have when in public and in my private world when nobody is watching? How would I want others to describe me? Let's say that you want others to see you as being authentic, and YOU also value authenticity as something you want to live by. You may feel like this value is currently at odds with the behaviors you are engaging in right now. That you are not being the person that you really are deep in your heart. This is not an unusual struggle when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual orientation. So please, try not to feel alone. We all know quite well how unacceptable it may be to be seen as gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc. And I am not just talking about being unaccepted by others, but a person may have a VERY hard time accepting themselves. Thinking about your values and living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom, but I won't lie, it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time. For example, someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for, even if that means people may disapprove. That may cause a lot of pain, but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity. It may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy, which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right for them. I would also sit down and think through some of the questions above and consider what your values are... both as an individual and as someone's fiancé.Above all, I wish you well in this journey.

How can I get them to stop and get along?", "chosen": "That is a good question. Unfortunately there is no generic answer with this one. Kids fight for different reasons - wanting attention, wanting respect, feeling jealous, wanting space and to be left alone, or a whole bunch of other reasons. Regardless of the underlying motivations for fighting, most conflicts result from misunderstandings and assumptions about the motivations of others and one of the best ways to start figuring out what is going on is to sit them down and have some conversations with them. These conversations should be centred on getting a better understanding of why they are angry with each other and really understanding them. It is important that they each know that you are committed to understanding their experience rather than simply sitting them down and lecturing them about what they are doing wrong. The more they are able to understand each other and feel understood the more likely they will be cooperative and considerate of each other. One exercise for doing this that can be very helpful is \"active listening\" where one person speaks and the other person reflects back what they heard the other person say and then checks for understanding.

This all seemed to begin after the end of a significant relationship. I was also dealing with my mom's business failing and my dad's ongoing health issues. The stress made everything feel pointless. I found some relief through regular gym workouts, but the last few weeks, the sleep problems and bad dreams have returned without any clear trigger. How should I address this sudden relapse?", "chosen": "Thank you for sharing what you've been going through. It sounds incredibly difficult to be dealing with such persistent sleep issues and distressing nightmares, especially after you had found some relief. It makes complete sense that you're feeling concerned and frustrated by this sudden relapse. Please know that your experience is a common and understandable response to the significant cumulative stress you've endured—the relationship ending, your family's struggles, and the feeling of pointlessness you described. Our minds and bodies often process unresolved stress and grief long after the initial events, and sleep is one of the first places this shows up.\n\nThe return of these symptoms, even without a clear new trigger, is an important signal from your nervous system that there may be underlying anxiety or trauma that needs to be processed. While the gym workouts are an excellent and healthy coping strategy for managing stress, they may not be fully addressing the root emotional material that is surfacing in your dreams. The themes of being chased and unable to breathe are very evocative of feelings of pressure, threat, and helplessness.\n\nGiven the intensity and recurrence of these nightmares, I strongly encourage you to consider connecting with a mental health professional. A therapist, particularly one trained in modalities like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) or trauma-focused approaches, can provide you with a safe space to process these experiences and give you specific tools to improve sleep and manage nightmares. They can help you develop a structured wind-down routine, techniques for \"rescripting\" nightmares, and ways to address the anxiety that fuels sleep onset issues.\n\nIn the immediate term, you might find it helpful to keep a notepad by your bed. If you wake from a nightmare, briefly jot down the dream or any feelings, then physically set the notebook aside as a symbolic way of setting the worry aside for the night. Also, try to gently reintroduce consistency with your sleep schedule and wind-down routine. You have already shown great strength in navigating these challenges, and seeking support for this next step is a powerful act of self-care.

However, this time, focus on relaxation techniques such as yoga or stretching, which can help reduce stress and promote better sleep.\n2.  **Mindfulness and meditation:** Mindfulness practices can help calm your mind and reduce stress. You can try guided meditation apps like Headspace, Calm, or Insight Timer that offer short sessions to get you started.\n3.  **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and emotions can help process and release them. Reflect on your journal entries to identify patterns or triggers that may be contributing to your sleep problems and nightmares.\n4.  **Reach out to a therapist:** Consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you address underlying emotional issues and develop coping strategies.

How can I cope with this daily stress?", "chosen": "Thank you for sharing what you're going through. It takes courage to acknowledge feelings of burnout, especially in a high-pressure environment like a startup. What you're describing—feeling constantly stretched thin, undervalued, and under-compensated—is incredibly draining, both emotionally and physically. Your feelings of stress and frustration are completely valid and a common human response to the situation you've outlined.\n\nFirst, let's focus on some immediate coping strategies for the daily stress. I encourage you to build small, non-negotiable buffers into your day. This could be a five-minute mindfulness or breathing exercise before a meeting, a proper lunch break away from your desk, or a firm end-time to your workday to create separation. As a project manager, you might also practice \"stress inoculation\" by anticipating high-pressure moments and mentally rehearsing calm, assertive communication. Physically, prioritizing basic sleep, nutrition, and even short walks can significantly regulate your nervous system.\n\nHowever, while coping mechanisms are essential, they don't address the root causes you've identified: unrealistic deadlines and low pay. This is where professional boundaries become crucial. I encourage you to prepare for a factual, solution-oriented conversation with leadership. Document specific examples of unrealistic deadlines and their impacts (e.g., on quality or team morale), and be prepared to propose adjusted timelines or necessary resources. Frame it from a perspective of sustainability and project success. If this feels too risky or if such conversations have failed before, it may be a sign to professionally evaluate your options elsewhere.\n\nBurnout is a signal that your current situation is unsustainable. If these feelings persist or deepen, especially if you notice changes in sleep, appetite, or mood that concern you, I strongly recommend connecting with a therapist.

A lapse in a boundary you set for yourself does not automatically mean your partner is not \"the one,\" nor does it define your worth or the relationship's potential.

Then, consider requesting a confidential meeting with a trusted mentor within the firm, a senior associate known for being reasonable, or your direct supervisor.

Being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstood.Many people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions. For example, men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness. Therefore, many men learned to turn feelings of sadness, insecurities, or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger. Being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear. Instead it makes us learn how to express it in other, incorrect, ways. If a man never learns to say “I am sad” or “that really hurt my feelings” and instead lashes out in anger, then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling, which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstood.You can control yourself and not explode. Walk away, remove yourself from the situation, do whatever you have to do to not lash out. Instead of reacting the way you normally would, go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a “simple” thing upset you.

It's a one time thing, and I never see them twice.", "chosen": "Hello, and thank you for your question. The question about whether or not to cheat is based on personal values that can only be answered by you. However, here are a few things to consider and questions to ask yourself to help you find your answer: 1. Do you feel like you are violating your own values or morals? This is important, because we all have different values and morals surrounding sex, love, and monogamy. If you value monogamous relationships and find yourself cheating on your partner, then you may feel like you are living in contradiction to your values, and most people are not happy when they do that. However, if monogamy is not something you value, then perhaps it is time to re-evaluate the relationship and determine if it is still right for you. Not all people want monogamous relationships, and that is alright. Finally, if you value your husband’s feelings and know that the affairs would hurt him, then your behaviors may again be in contrast to your own values. That can only be determined by you. 2. Based on how you describe your relationship, it sounds like you are not very satisfied with the way it is. From the outside, it looks like the affairs are a way to “get even” with your husband or to feel better after an argument. This is something that can happen when mutual respect starts to fade in a relationship and gets replaced with contempt. We can simply stop caring about how our actions hurt each other, or potentially hurt each other. Perhaps the question to ask here is, when you look out toward the future with your husband, is this the pattern that you want to keep? The pattern of very little sex, argument, and then satisfying the pain or dissatisfaction with affairs. 3. What are your goals for this relationship? If we start to become disconnected in a relationship, we can begin to do things on autopilot. Get up, get the kids up, go to work, come home, and go to bed. None of which requires any intimacy at all. Are you still able to see the hopes and dreams you once had for this relationship? 4. Have you considered seeking marital counseling? Not having affairs won’t actually fix the part of the relationship that is leading you to have them. If there is something broken, it sometimes requires some help to get it fixed.

It takes a lot of self-awareness to recognize this pattern, and I hear the conflict in your words—you have a genuine desire to be productive and efficient, yet it seems to pull you into a space that distances you from your partner and perhaps even from your own intentions. That can feel very frustrating and confusing.\n\nWhat you're describing is a behavior that, for many, can cross into compulsive territory. The drive to create a \"perfect\" system, the loss of time, and the need to justify the time spent are significant signs. It’s important to explore what this activity provides for you. Is it a sense of control, a way to unwind, or a method to avoid other thoughts or feelings? Often, these behaviors serve an emotional purpose.\n\nWhile I can offer some initial guidance, this pattern is something that would be very beneficial to explore in ongoing therapy. A professional can help you understand the root causes and develop a personalized plan. For now, I encourage you to start with two practical steps. First, set a physical, non-negotiable timer for these activities—when it goes off, you shut the laptop. Second, communicate with your partner: before you start, tell them what you're doing and for how long, and check in when the timer ends. This builds accountability and reconnection.\n\nYour partner’s observation is a gift—it’s a signal that your behavior is impacting your relationship, which is often our most meaningful source of connection.

On one hand, it's great that you're looking to optimize your workflow and make the most of your time. On the other hand, it can lead to procrastination, as you get sidetracked by the endless options and features that technology provides.\n\nHere are a few strategies that might help you avoid getting sucked into the rabbit hole:\n\n1. **Set a timer:** Set a timer for a specific amount of time, say 30 minutes or an hour, and challenge yourself to stay focused on your task during that time. When the timer goes off, take a break and come back to it later.\n2. **Make a list:** Write down what you want to accomplish and prioritize your tasks.

I hear the confusion, hurt, and sense of betrayal you're experiencing.

The foundation of therapy is built on clear, professional boundaries designed to protect you, and it's clear those boundaries have become significantly blurred, which is not your fault.\n\nFrom a professional ethics standpoint, your counselor's acceptance of a personal loan was a serious boundary violation. Her subsequent visit to your apartment, while you were under the influence of pain medication, compounds this violation significantly and is unequivocally unethical. Her current withdrawal—ceasing communication and canceling sessions—is an abandonment of her professional responsibility and leaves you without proper closure or care.\n\nMy strongest recommendation is for you to seek support from a new, independent mental health professional. They can help you process this breach of trust and the complex feelings that come with it. To address the ethical violations, you have the right to file a formal complaint with her licensing board (such as your state's Board of Behavioral Health). This is not an act of vengeance, but a step to uphold professional standards and protect others.\n\nFor your immediate well-being, please lean on your personal support system.

Being bisexual can be particularly difficult because it is often misunderstood, even by people who are “supposed” to be part of your own community, such as lesbians and gays. It happens so often that there is actually a term for it – bi-erasure. This is simply something that happens when people deny that bisexuality is a real thing, or discriminate against bisexuals due to beliefs like your parents seem to have. The unfortunate truth is that you can never be sure of how you parents may take this kind of information. It sounds promising that they are accepting of other sexual orientations, and it may simply be that your parents lack education about bisexuality. With accurate information, they may come around, but there is no way to be sure. Some of my colleagues have already given you good information. Here are some more things that you can consider and questions you can ask yourself before making the decision to tell them: 1. If they don’t respond the way you want them to, have you developed a support system to support you through it? This is very important. The truth is that all the friends in the world won’t prevent pain or sadness if your parents don’t respond as you hope, but they will at least be there to remind you that you ARE okay as you are. And that is critical for you to remember. 2. There is great information on the internet about bisexuality that you can offer your parents if you think it would be helpful. It may be important for them to know the kind of damage that is being done to bisexual adults and young people because of the myths surrounding bisexuality. Here is an article from GLAAD about bi-erasure: http://www.glaad.org/bisexual/bierasure 3. Coming out to people is obviously deeply personal and should only take place when you are ready. Sometimes people get pressured from friends, media, and even people they are romantically involved with to come out before they are ready. It really is up to you. If you are feeling pressure from others, don’t feel bad about setting your boundaries and telling them that you will come out on your own time. Intimate partners should respect you enough to understand this. 4. Something else to think about is your own comfort in being bisexual. Just because someone is LGBTQ doesn’t mean that they necessarily want to be. Many people struggle with this. Having your own doubts or insecurities may also play a part in how comfortable you are in telling your parents. So, perhaps do some self-exploration about your feelings toward yourself. Sometimes people take friends with them when they decide to come out to their parents. This is something you may want to consider. The important thing to remember is that you are okay. Really. If your parents don’t respond well, that doesn’t mean that they never will. Some start off upset, but then work their way through it. Best of luck to you. Robin J.

However, it's important to understand that these changes are often the result of a collaborative process, not just the act of talking itself. A counselor provides a safe, confidential space where you can explore your thoughts and feelings without judgment. Together, we work to identify unhelpful patterns, develop new coping strategies, and build a deeper understanding of yourself. This process can lead to tangible outcomes like reduced anxiety, improved communication in relationships, better emotional regulation, and clearer decision-making.\n\nIt's also fair to acknowledge that counseling isn't a magic cure. Its effectiveness depends on factors like the fit between you and your counselor, your readiness to engage in the process, and the nature of the challenges you're facing. The work sometimes involves sitting with difficult emotions, which can feel challenging in the short term, even as it leads to long-term growth.\n\nIf you are considering this step, I encourage you to view it as an active partnership.

Counseling, also known as therapy, is a highly effective way to address a wide range of issues, from mental health concerns to relationship problems and career challenges. Here are some ways in which talking to a professional counselor can lead to positive changes:\n\n1. **Identifying and addressing underlying issues**: A counselor can help you identify the root causes of your problems, whether it's a mental health condition, a traumatic event, or a pattern of negative thoughts and behaviors. By addressing the underlying issues, you can break free from the cycle of negative patterns and develop more effective coping strategies.\n\n2. **Developing coping skills and strategies**: Counselors can teach you healthy coping mechanisms, such as stress management, mindfulness, and problem-solving skills, which can help you navigate challenging situations more effectively.\n\n3. **Building self-awareness and self-acceptance**: Through counseling, you'll gain a deeper understanding of your strengths, values, and goals, leading to greater self-awareness and self-acceptance.

Mixing daily cannabis with prescribed mood stabilizers is a serious matter that can interfere with the medication's efficacy and stability. This moves beyond a relational issue into a health concern.

You cannot manage this for him, but you can encourage him to have an open conversation with his prescribing doctor or therapist about the interaction. That is the most important step he could take.\n\nPlease remember to also tend to your own emotional needs.

Your feelings of questioning and disillusionment are completely valid and, in my experience, a very human response to betrayal.\n\nIt makes sense that your spiritual beliefs, once a source of comfort, now feel like they might be part of a story you were told. When human institutions or relationships fail us, it's natural to wonder if the foundations they were built on are also flawed. This period of questioning, while deeply unsettling, can also be a sacred space—a time to discern what is *truly* yours from what you may have inherited or absorbed from others.\n\nI want to offer a couple of gentle, practical steps you might consider. First, practice self-compassion. This is a tender time; treat yourself with the kindness you would offer a dear friend in crisis. Second, instead of trying to immediately rebuild a grand belief system, try focusing on small, concrete experiences of meaning. This could be moments of connection with nature, acts of kindness, or creative expression. Ask yourself: \"What feels authentically meaningful to me in this moment, even if it's small?\" Journaling these observations can be helpful.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge that this is a significant life transition, and working through it with a therapist or spiritual director can provide invaluable support. If your feelings of instability ever lead to thoughts of hopelessness or self-harm, please reach out to a crisis line or mental health professional immediately.\n\nYou are not alone in this search. Sometimes, what is \"real\" to hold onto emerges not from a perfect, unchanging doctrine, but from the quiet, resilient truth you discover within yourself as you heal. I am here to support you in that process.", "rejected": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through a tough time. It's completely normal to question your beliefs when faced with disappointment and betrayal. It takes a lot of courage to confront your doubts and seek truth. Here are some suggestions that might help you find something real to hold onto:\n\n1.  **Explore your personal experiences**: Reflect on the times when you felt a deep sense of connection to your spiritual beliefs. What were those moments like? What made them special? Try to recall the emotions you felt during those experiences. This can help you identify what resonates with you and what you're looking for in a spiritual practice.\n2.  **Reflect on your values**: What values do you hold dear? What matters to you in life? What kind of relationships do you want to cultivate? What kind of community or group do you want to be a part of? Consider how these values and aspirations can guide your search for meaning and purpose.\n3.  **Explore different spiritual practices**: Try out different spiritual practices, such as meditation, yoga, or prayer. See what resonates with you and what brings you a sense of connection. You might be surprised at how different practices can help you find what you're looking for.\n4.  **Seek out role models", "topic": "spirituality", "judge_reason": "Response A demonstrates superior empathy by deeply validating the client's experience, integrates questioning as a 'sacred space,' provides more nuanced and actionable guidance focused on self-compassion and small meanings, explicitly addresses safety with crisis resources, and maintains clearer professional boundaries by framing suggestions gently and recommending therapeutic support."}

Since then, he's been distant and ended our therapeutic relationship abruptly.

I hear how hurt, confused, and betrayed you feel after a five-year therapeutic relationship has ended so abruptly and under such complicated circumstances. It is completely understandable to be grieving not only the loss of your psychologist's support but also the loss of what felt like a genuine friendship. You placed significant trust in this relationship, and its sudden end is a lot to process.\n\nFrom a professional ethics standpoint, I want to validate your perception. The core foundation of effective therapy is a relationship with clear, consistent boundaries designed to protect your well-being. Lending money, even between friends, and a home visit—especially when you were in a vulnerable state on medication—are significant boundary crossings that blur the professional relationship. The responsibility for maintaining these boundaries rests entirely with the psychologist. His subsequent distancing and termination, while likely his attempt to correct the boundary violation, were handled in a manner that has caused you further harm, which is not acceptable.\n\nMy primary concern is for your continuity of care. This rupture is a significant therapeutic issue in itself. I strongly encourage you to seek support from a new, licensed mental health professional. A new therapist can provide a safe, ethical space to process this painful termination, the boundary violations, and the original issues you were working on. This is not something you should have to navigate alone.\n\nIn the immediate term, be gentle with yourself. This is a loss. You might find it helpful to journal your thoughts and feelings about the relationship—both the positive support and the hurtful ending. If you feel it is appropriate, you can also contact your local psychology licensing board to seek information or file a complaint, as they oversee ethical conduct. Your feelings are important, and you deserve ethical, consistent, and professional care.", "rejected": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this difficult situation. It's completely understandable that you feel hurt and confused. \n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that what you're experiencing is a complex situation. Your actions, such as lending money as a friend, were indeed kind and generous. However, as a client in therapy, there's a power imbalance between you and your psychologist. This power imbalance can sometimes lead to blurred boundaries, making it challenging to navigate situations like this.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that your psychologist's actions may have crossed professional boundaries. By lending money as a friend, you've blurred the line between a therapeutic relationship and a personal friendship. This can create an expectation of reciprocity, which may not be feasible in a therapeutic setting.\n\nRegarding your psychologist's abrupt termination of the therapeutic relationship, it's possible that he may have felt uncomfortable with the blurred boundaries or the expectation of a personal relationship. This could be due to various reasons, such as feeling uncertain about how to navigate the situation or feeling that the relationship had become too informal.\n\nTo handle this situation, consider the following steps:\n\n1.  **Take time to process your emotions**: Allow yourself to feel your emotions and grieve the loss of the therapeutic relationship.

I can hear the frustration and uncertainty in your question, and it's completely understandable to feel that way when you've taken the proactive step to seek support again and haven't heard back. It can be disheartening and may bring up feelings of being overlooked, especially when you're motivated to re-engage in your therapeutic work.\n\nFrom a professional and ethical standpoint, while a counselor has a general duty to provide for client welfare, there is no universally mandated obligation to respond to a former client seeking to re-establish care after several months. However, best practice and common professional courtesy strongly suggest that a response—even a brief one to acknowledge your inquiry and explain availability or provide a referral—is the standard of care. The lack of response could be due to several factors, such as your message not being received, the counselor being out of office, a change in their practice status, or an oversight in a busy schedule.\n\nFor practical guidance, I recommend taking a two-step approach. First, give it a few more business days and then try one more clear, concise communication through the practice's main phone line or portal, stating your request to resume therapy and asking for a confirmation of receipt. If you still receive no reply, the second step is to seek care elsewhere. You can contact your insurance provider for a list of in-network therapists, use a reputable therapist directory, or ask your primary care physician for a referral. Your well-being is the priority, and you deserve to connect with a professional who is available and responsive to your needs.\n\nPlease know that your initiative to return to counseling is a significant and positive step for your mental health.

This will ensure you receive integrated and effective care. As a first, actionable step, I encourage you to search for therapists in your area who list these specialties. You can use directories like Psychology Today, and filter for providers who mention \"sex addiction\" (or \"compulsive sexual behavior\") and \"eating disorders.\" Many therapists offer free brief consultations; this can help you find someone you feel comfortable with.\n\nWhile you are seeking that ongoing support, please practice self-compassion. These behaviors are often coping mechanisms for deeper emotional pain. If you feel a binge or compulsive urge arising, if possible, pause and try to identify the emotion underneath it.

When I drink too much, I have a sharp temper and have picked fights with my husband. I haven't had an incident lately, but the morning after a heavy drinking session, I'm overwhelmed with guilt, even if nothing bad happened. Why do I feel this way? Does this indicate I'm developing a problem with alcohol?", "chosen": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes a great deal of self-awareness and courage to reflect on your relationship with alcohol and its impact on your life and marriage. The feelings of guilt and concern you're experiencing are very common and important signals from your own values and emotions. Please know that your feelings are valid, and you are not alone in this struggle.\n\nWhat you're describing—the sharp temper, relationship conflicts, and the profound \"hangxiety\" or guilt the next day—are significant indicators that alcohol is having a negative impact on your well-being. The guilt often stems from a disconnect between your actions while intoxicated and your core values, like being a loving partner. Even if no major incident occurred, that emotional hangover is your mind and body's way of signaling that this pattern is distressing and unsustainable.\n\nYes, these patterns can indicate the beginning of an alcohol use disorder. A key hallmark is when drinking causes repeated negative consequences in your personal life, which you have clearly identified. The fact that you are concerned about it is a powerful reason to explore it further.\n\nAs a next step, I gently encourage you to seek a professional evaluation. A therapist specializing in substance use or a medical doctor can provide a confidential, non-judgmental assessment. They can help you understand the role alcohol plays in your life and explore strategies, which may include moderation techniques or support groups like SMART Recovery or Women for Sobriety. In the meantime, you might find it helpful to track your drinking and the feelings associated with it, and to have an open conversation with your husband about your concerns when you are both calm and sober.\n\nYour proactive concern is the first and most important step toward positive change.

These emotions can be intense, making you feel like you've let yourself and others down.\n2.  **Self-Condemnation:** When you drink heavily, you might feel like you've lost control, which can trigger self-criticism. This can lead to negative self-talk and feelings of regret, even if you didn't do anything bad.\n3.  **Alcohol's Impact on Emotions:** Alcohol is a depressant, and its effects can linger even after you've stopped drinking. This can lead to feelings of low mood, anxiety, or irritability, which may contribute to your guilt and regret.\n4.  **Hormonal Changes:** Hormonal fluctuations, particularly in women, can affect mood and emotional regulation.

Now my daughters favor him after all the sacrifices I made for them the past 15 years as a single mom.

I’m not sure how to handle this.", "chosen": "Hi Arkansas, Your situation sounds like a case of parental alienation. Your ex-partner unfortunately has the power to say things to your children that poison their relationship with you. It's a form of woman abuse and child abuse. He's likely doing this to hurt you and have power over you, and he's not considering how it's affecting the kids. I've seen this happen in many families; parents who once had a strong loving relationship with their children suddenly feel abandoned in favor of the other parent. In some cases, children actually stop having contact with one parent, who is left bewildered and powerless. It's your ex's job to support your relationship with your kids, not try to destroy it. While you can't change his behaviours, and I think you know that, there are things you can do for yourself and your kids. For your children, you can refuse to enter into the war he's setting up. He's trying to provoke you into acting \"crazy\", but you don't have to fall for this. If you run around screaming \"he's lying!\", it only makes you look more 'crazy'. Try to stay calm, and don't put their dad down to them, no matter how tempting it is. One day, they may be ready to hear the truth of your relationship with their father, but wait until they ask. Trust that they have their own experience of their dad, and trust that he doesn't have the power to destroy their love for you. Children, in the long term, lose respect for parents who denigrate the other parent. They see who their dad is already, I'd bet, but they don't know how to cope with that. If he's the only one fighting a war, you're helping them feel less trapped in a parental conflict. Don't engage on his level. Don't blame your children completely. Although I have to say that for them to call you names like crazy is not acceptable and you don't need to tolerate that disrespect, try to deal with this behaviour without bringing their dad into it. They are acting out their father's agenda, likely because they instinctively see his weakness. Children often support the weaker parent, rather than abandon them. You get the worst because they trust your love. But you can still have boundaries. Letting them abuse you isn't the answer, but have compassion for their position. This picture isn't their fault, but as adults, they can be held accountable for their choices.Reassure yourself that you are the mom you know you are. You don't need them to gush all over you in order to know that you made sacrifices. Hold onto the likelihood that some day, they will come back and be grateful. It may take a while, you can't rush it, but they will see you for who you are. Your power is in giving them a consistently calm, generous, connected, supportive mom who refuses to play games or be walked on. I'd recommend trying to connect with other parents who experience this phenomenon, or a therapist who can reinforce these goals and help keep you grounded.

It takes courage to acknowledge these complex feelings, especially in a workplace setting where the stakes feel so high. What you're describing—a strong connection, a shared history, and now this period of confusion and pulling back—is understandably challenging. It's natural to feel conflicted when deep friendship, romantic interest, and professional boundaries all intersect.\n\nFirst, I want to validate your instinct to pull back and create some space for yourself. That is a wise and self-protective step when feelings become overwhelming. It allows you to gain clarity on what you truly need and want, separate from the daily interactions at work. This situation highlights the importance of professional and personal boundaries, which can become blurred in these circumstances. It might be helpful to gently assess what level of interaction you can maintain that feels respectful to your emotional well-being and your professional responsibilities.\n\nAs a practical step, consider setting some gentle internal boundaries for yourself. This could mean limiting one-on-one social interactions outside of work for a time, or consciously redirecting conversations at work to neutral, project-related topics. Journaling can be a helpful tool to untangle your feelings and identify any patterns. It's also crucial to nurture other parts of your life—your friendships outside of work, hobbies, and self-care routines—to ensure this relationship doesn't become your sole emotional focus.\n\nGiven the complexity of navigating both a workplace and a close personal dynamic, if these feelings persist and cause significant distress, seeking a few sessions with a therapist could provide a confidential space to explore this more deeply.

Why do I feel so alone?", "chosen": "It has been said that depression is often the result of a blocked goal. Often people struggle with both anxiety and depression but have difficulty determining which is the most important issue. For some, depression is the result of frequently blocked goals and when their predominant issues are evaluated, they discover that they are anxious (worried) about a lot of areas in their life but seem to find no relief. When there is no relief and there have been numerous attempts (either in their mind or in practical application) to resolve the anxiety, depression is often the result. In this type of case, depression is not the main or underlying issue. The anxiety is the underlying issue. Having \"a lot on my mind\" sounds like anxiety. Unresolved anxiety can lead to feelings of depression which are often associated with \"emptiness.\" In the question above, I would want to evaluate all of the issues surrounding having \"a lot on my mind\" and determine where these might be coming from. Has there been ongoing rejection from peers? From family? If so, why does this seem to be happening? Isolation is often a protective measure that one implements to avoid further pain. Where does that need to protect originate? Are there unmet needs from childhood? Are there traumatic life events that have created a need to self-protect as a defense mechanism? We can feel \"alone\" even when in a crow of people or at a party. This has nothing, in this case, to do with being around people. It has more to do with how we view ourselves. If there is a prevailing message or script that has been internalized that says, \"You are worth nothing\" or \"You don't deserve the company of others\" then being around people will not alleviate the problem but only exacerbate it. I would want to evaluate how one feels about themselves and what negative messages one has received and has repeated to oneself over time. The Developmental Needs Meeting Strategy is a therapy aimed at addressing unmet childhood needs. If there is specific trauma that is associated with socializing with people, then EMDR can be very helpful in desensitizing and reprocessing the trauma.

The physical withdrawal is manageable, but I can't seem to stop the obsessive thoughts about it. What strategies help with the psychological part of addiction?", "chosen": "Thank you for sharing this with me. First, I want to acknowledge the strength and love for your family that it takes to make this decision. Wanting to be healthier for your child is a powerful motivator, and it's completely understandable that the psychological cravings feel like the biggest hurdle. The obsessive thoughts are a normal, though very challenging, part of the process. Your experience of managing the physical withdrawal but getting stuck on the mental component is incredibly common, and it's where the real work of building new habits begins.\n\nWhat you're describing is the brain's deeply ingrained habit loop—certain times, places, or emotions have become automatic triggers for chewing. The key is to disrupt that loop with conscious strategies.\n\nFirst, let's practice **\"urge surfing.\"** Instead of fighting the thought, observe it. Notice it as a wave that builds, peaks, and then subsides. Remind yourself, \"This is just a craving, and it will pass.\" Breathe through it for 2-3 minutes; often the intensity fades.\n\nNext, **identify and replace.** What are your top three trigger situations? Is it after a meal, during a work break, or while driving? For each one, plan a specific, healthier replacement behavior. This could be chewing gum, sunflower seeds, doing a quick set of stretches, or taking five deep breaths. The action physically and mentally fills the space the habit once occupied.\n\nAlso, **practice self-compassion.** When a thought intrudes, avoid self-criticism. Gently say, \"There's that thought again,\" and consciously redirect your attention to something immediate, like playing with your child. Every time you successfully ride out a craving, you are rewiring your brain.\n\nFinally, consider **seeking additional support.** A therapist specializing in addiction or a tobacco cessation program can provide structured cognitive-behavioral techniques and accountability.

It takes a great deal of self-awareness and courage to recognize that your focus on performance has shifted into something that is now affecting your energy and mood. What you're describing sounds incredibly challenging, especially within the high-pressure environment of college athletics, where the line between dedication and over-control can become blurred. Your feelings are completely valid.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge the strength it took to voice this concern. What you're experiencing—the fixation on food, the social withdrawal from team dinners, and the impact on your well-being—are significant signs that this has moved beyond performance optimization. It’s a common and painful progression, but it’s also one that can be addressed with the right support.\n\nAs a counselor, my primary concern is your health and safety. Rigid food rules and significant changes in energy and mood can have serious physical and psychological consequences. For this reason, I must strongly encourage you to connect with a professional who specializes in eating disorders. A treatment team, including a therapist, a registered dietitian (preferably one with sports experience), and your primary care doctor, can create a plan that supports both your mental health and your athletic goals. Your college likely has counseling and health services that can provide a confidential starting point.\n\nAs a next step, consider sharing your struggle with someone you trust, perhaps a coach, athletic trainer, or team doctor who can help you access resources. In the short term, try to gently challenge one rule—maybe attending the next team dinner and focusing on the social connection rather than the food. Your worth as an athlete and a person is not defined by grams or a specific physique, but by your whole self. You don't have to navigate this alone, and reaching out is the most important first step you've already taken.", "rejected": "It sounds like you're experiencing a concerning situation where your pursuit of optimal performance has led to an unhealthy relationship with food.

Are you doing this for yourself, for your team, or for someone else's expectations? Ask yourself if there's a healthier way to achieve your goals.\n\n2.  **Seek support**: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or a sports psychologist about your struggles. They may be able to offer a different perspective or provide support in a way that you haven't considered before.\n\n3  **Focus on performance, not perfection**: It's okay to strive for your best, but remember that perfection is unattainable. Focus on progress, not perfection. This might help you feel less pressure to be perfect.\n\n4  **Nutrition and recovery**: Make sure you're fueling your body with a balanced diet that includes all the necessary nutrients for optimal performance. Don't feel like you have to eat only specific foods, as this can lead to nutrient deficiencies.\n\n5  **Self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy, like exercise", "topic": "eating-disorders", "judge_reason": "Response A demonstrates superior empathy, validates the client's experience, prioritizes safety by strongly recommending a specialized professional and treatment team, provides specific, actionable short-term guidance, and maintains clear professional boundaries.

In fact, it is one of the most frequent experiences clients report. Therapy is a unique space designed to be a safe container for emotions that you may have been holding back or managing alone.

For instance, in some cultures, it's considered a sign of strength and emotional intelligence to be able to express one's feelings openly. In other cultures, it may be seen as a sign of weakness or vulnerability.\n\nHowever, societal expectations around emotional expression can vary widely. In some cultures, people may be encouraged to bottle up their emotions and not show them, especially in certain situations or in front of certain people.

When initiating conversations about subjects that are sensitive, there are a few things that you want to remember. Tell him how you are feeling and what you are experiencing, rather than blaming him or telling him what he is doing wrong. Avoid using extreme, black and white language (i.e. always and never).

You are lucky to have a loving, compassionate partner, and your boyfriend is lucky to have a partner who takes full responsibility for their actions. My hunch is that you learned some things about yourself when you were younger that are playing a role here. Your sense of worthlessness seems out of proportion to the mistakes you made. You don't have to be perfect in order to deserve the love of a good man. You only have to have the maturity to recognise when you've hurt someone and work hard to make it better. Who in your life overreacted to small mistakes you made? Were you shamed as a child? Did you learn that you deserved to be punished? Did something bad happen that you thought was your fault? Is there a mistake you made long ago that you need forgiveness for? There is a younger person inside you waiting to be forgiven for something they weren't entirely responsible for. The bar is too high for you. If I was your therapist, I would work with you to find the source of the shame, and address that wound. If you want to move forward and be with your boyfriend, your job will be to forgive yourself.

When he demands you leave your shared home during fights, it creates an unstable and frightening environment for you and your child.\n\nYour desire to try counseling is understandable, but it's important to know that couples counseling is not typically recommended in relationships where there is a controlling or abusive power dynamic, as it can sometimes escalate risk or be used to further manipulate. His refusal to communicate openly is a major barrier. I strongly encourage you to seek individual counseling for yourself. A therapist can provide you with dedicated support to sort through your feelings, strengthen your sense of self, and help you create a safety plan.\n\nA crucial first step would be to connect with your local domestic violence hotline.

It's okay to politely deflect or not engage in personal banter for a while.

This could be journaling, confiding in a trusted friend (unconnected to work), or speaking with a counselor. You need a space to grieve the \"what if\" without it impacting your work dynamic.\n4.  **Re-evaluate the Dynamic:** If, after setting these internal and professional boundaries, the friendship feels unsustainable or too painful, it is okay to let it naturally become a more distant, collegial relationship. Your emotional health is paramount.\n\nThis is a process, not a quick fix. Be patient and compassionate with yourself.

If this is the case, talk with your provider or consider seeing a counselor who may be able to help. 3. Something to consider is that once we start to have anxiety or stress about something, we can begin to obsess about it. My guess is that going to bed for sleep is no longer a pleasant thing for you. Your stress and fear of what may happen when you sleep could start way before you actually go to bed. This could increase your chances of having another bad dream. Try relaxation techniques before going to bed. If you have YouTube, you can pull up \"Guided Meditation for Sleep\" exercises to help you relax. There are many different ones to choose from. You may also want to try deep breathing.4. There are self-help ideas for managing bad nightmares. If you Google search \"Nightmare Rescripting\" or \"Nightmare Exposure\" you may find some ideas and instructions on how to manage dreams. I hope these ideas help. Be well... Robin J.

While I'm not a medical professional, I'll offer some suggestions that may help you address this issue.\n\n**Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that nightmares can be a symptom of an underlying issue, such as anxiety, stress, or trauma.** It's possible that your brain is processing unresolved emotions or experiences that are manifesting as nightmares. Consider speaking with a therapist or counselor to explore this further.\n\nThat being said, here are some strategies that may help reduce the frequency and intensity of nightmares:\n\n1.  **Establish a relaxing bedtime routine**: Develop a calming pre-sleep routine, such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or reading a book. This can signal to your brain that it's time to relax and prepare for sleep.\n2.  **Practice relaxation techniques**: Regularly practicing relaxation techniques like progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, or yoga can help calm your mind and body before sleep.\n3.  **Improve sleep hygiene**: Ensure a consistent sleep schedule, avoid caffeine and electronics before bedtime, and create a sleep-conducive environment (dark, quiet, cool).\n4.  **Keep a dream journal**: Writing", "topic": "anxiety", "judge_reason": "Response A demonstrates superior empathy by directly validating the client's fear and impact on daily life, offers more specific, actionable strategies (e.g., medication review, guided meditation, nightmare rescripting), and maintains clear professional boundaries by citing credentials and consistently suggesting consultation with a provider.

Your mother's threats regarding legal custody are a significant source of pressure. I strongly encourage you to connect with a professional who can provide specific guidance on your legal rights as a teenager. A school counselor, a social worker, or a local domestic violence agency can often help navigate these situations and may connect you with legal advocacy.

You might consider, when you feel ready, having a one-on-one conversation with your boyfriend to share what you feel comfortable with. His support could be crucial. However, protecting your emotional energy is also valid; you are not obligated to justify your life experiences to anyone.\n\nThe core of this is building your own support system. Your aunt's home seems to be a place of safety—lean into that. Continue to prioritize your own stability, your education, and your healing.

Has anything scary ever happened to you at night? Answering that question may give you the \"why\" of where that's coming from. If you haven't had a bad experience at night, it may just be the time when you have nothing to do, which allows more intense thoughts and feelings to surface. Here's a couple things to try:One thing you could do is sit down a couple hours before you go to bed and journal (if you can). Try to reduce any distractions and just go for it. The purpose of this is to slow down well before you go to bed, expressing some of the anxiety from the day. Also take note of the things you can tackle that day vs what can wait until later. This gives your brain a chance to sort through some of the \"planning\" type of anxiety that commonly comes up when you are trying to sleep.Another thing you can do is make a list of the things you have control over. Anxiety is really good at putting everything you feel out of control of on a giant metaphorical projection screen. Try projecting some of the things you have control over instead. For example--you have total control over breathing patterns, what you choose to wear the next day, what you pay attention to if you go for a walk, etc. You also have control over how you personalize that list to what matters to you. Mindfulness is a great way to focus on how you control your breath, and also how letting go of breathing doesn't stop your body from doing what it's always doing to keep you alive. Any google search will bring up lots of information on this!Something to remember is that experiencing anxiety is OK. It doesn't mean something is necessarily wrong. Anxiety is sometimes just a feeling that comes up without much of a cause. If you can't identify that cause, it's probably because of a little misinterpretation in the brain. Mindfulness can definitely help with that.", "rejected": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling scared of sleeping alone. That's completely understandable.

I would encourage you to ask your boyfriend to be patient with you at this time until you figure out what is going on. I encourage you to then think very deeply about what your reservations, if any, about being sexually active. Do you fear pregnancy? Are there problems in the relationship? Are you afraid of the emotional intimacy? Another question that comes to mind is whether or not you have any history of sexual activity that you did not consent to that might be getting in the way. When these types of traumatic events occur, people can essentially become triggered negatively by anything that reminds them of past trauma. Such events can cause an aversion to sex even if there is now a loving relationship whom one wants to be sexually active with. If this is the case I strongly recommend individual therapy to begin working through some of these issues. A final area that you might explore would be whether or not you are experiencing pain with penetration. If so, I would recommend that you schedule an appointment with a gynecologist to rule out any type of medical issues that might be causing these problems.

He's usually very affectionate with me, but if he wakes up from a nap feeling groggy or has a bad dream, he pushes me away and insists on only his mom, even if she's busy. Later he's fine.

It can feel confusing and even a little hurtful when a child we're close to pushes us away in those vulnerable moments, so I want to first validate that your feelings are completely understandable.\n\nWhat you're describing is very developmentally appropriate for a five-year-old. When children are in a state of partial arousal—like just waking from a nap or recovering from a bad dream—their emotional brain takes over. In that groggy, distressed state, their primary attachment figure (his mom) is their ultimate source of safety and comfort. It's not a rejection of you, but a powerful, instinctual drive for the person he associates with core security. The fact that he reconnects with you later, when fully awake and regulated, is a strong sign of the secure and loving bond you share.\n\nIn the moment, the most supportive response is to calmly and warmly honor his request. You might say, \"I hear you, you want Mommy right now. That's okay. I'll stay right here while we get her.\" This validates his feelings without taking his push-away personally. Stay present and calm, providing a quiet, safe space until his mom can take over. Your steady, unflustered presence, even from a slight distance, is still a form of comfort. Avoid expressing disappointment or trying to persuade him to accept your comfort, as this can increase his distress.\n\nYou are providing him with a wonderful secondary attachment figure—a safe adult who respects his boundaries and emotional needs.

This anxiety can lead them to push away others, including you, when they're feeling vulnerable or uncertain.\n2.  **Emotional regulation**: Children's emotional regulation skills are still developing, and they may not have the ability to manage their feelings effectively. When your nephew wakes up from a nap or has a bad dream, he may feel scared, anxious, or overwhelmed, leading him to push you away and seek comfort from his mom.\n3.  **Imprinting**: Children often imprint on their primary caregivers, which means they associate their caregivers with safety, security, and comfort. When your nephew is feeling vulnerable, he may instinctively seek out his mom, who is the primary caregiver, even if you're the one who's currently with him.\n\nTo respond to this behavior in the moment, try the following:\n\n1.  **Stay calm**: Remain calm and understanding, even if", "topic": "children-adolescents", "judge_reason": "Response A demonstrates superior empathy by validating the aunt's feelings, provides more developmentally precise and actionable guidance, and maintains a warm, professional tone that models therapeutic best practices, while Response B is more generic and less emotionally attuned."}

I shoved her away to protect him, and now I'm wracked with guilt, even though she constantly chooses her destructive partner over family. He even tells people she's just a 'friend' he's helping out.

The escalation to physical confrontation is a serious sign that the current environment is becoming dangerous. Your primary concern now must be safety. I strongly encourage you to contact Adult Protective Services for your father, as he is an elderly person being financially exploited and emotionally abused in his own home. This is not about \"getting your sister in trouble,\" but about securing the well-being of a vulnerable adult.

These groups can provide you with specific strategies for detachment and boundary-setting that are sustainable, while also offering you crucial emotional support.\n\nYour sister’s addiction and her partner’s behavior have created an untenable situation. Setting boundaries is not abandonment; it is a necessary step to stop the drain on your family's resources and emotional health.

There are however, ways to address this. As for coping mechanisms, the person you work with should also look at offering you alternatives such as the skills found within the Dialectic Behavior Therapy model (DBT) which has several useful tools to help address the underlying anxiety and difficulty managing emotional regulation.

We really don't know if it's something psychological that's influencing your symptoms, or if there's other issues happening within the body. Pancreas or thyroid issues can perpetuate anxiety and depression symptoms pretty intensely--these are things your doctor knows more about and can help test for (and maybe rule out).As you probably already know, lack of sleep is a giant contributor to an increase in symptoms. We don't know too much about sleep in the research, but we do know it's necessary to function and function well. Some suggestions here from the research we do have: creating a calming routine at night can help with your body's relationship to sleep. This can be your normal nightly hygiene paired with some relaxing videos or soundscapes (there are apps for this--Calm, Headspace, PanicShield). Practicing these for a few weeks can help your brain pair your routine with sleeping. Another suggestion directly from the research is not to take naps. Yes, your brain needs sleep, but napping messes with our circadian rhythm and our quality/quantity of nightly sleep. When we sleep, we go through sleep stages--but when we nap, those stages aren't completed like they would be during a full night of sleep where we go through those stages multiple times. Both deep sleep and REM sleep (typically when we dream) seems to be especially important for feeling rested. Napping usually only offers us a small dose of that, whereas a full night can offer as many more completed cycles including both these stages.

Is there anything I can do to feel reconnected?", "chosen": "Your question highlights your pain very clearly. What you are describing is one of the most common scenarios I see in my practice with couples: One partner feels terribly lonely and unimportant in response to the other partner either turning towards other people and activities or being withdrawn and turning inward. My mind immediately goes to a question for you: What happens when you are feeling alone and uncared for? What do you say to yourself about you, about your spouse, and about your relationship? What do you do in response to these feelings? Do you ask for what you need? Does this lead to arguments? Do you stay silent or withdraw?Very often, couples enter into negative patterns where one partner feels afraid of rejection by the other partner and so withdraws from the relationship (and is often seen as \"cold and aloof\" towards the relationship), and the other partner feels afraid of abandonment by the withdrawing partner and so pursues the other (and is often seen as \"critical and nagging\"). Regardless of \"who started it,\" these patterns can turn into infinity loops that take on a gravity of their own, and ultimately cause both partners to withdraw and dissolve the relationship. If both partners want to work on saving and improving the relationship, the way out of this is to learn about your emotions and patterns together so that you can slow down the pattern and stay in touch with the emotions that pull people together. As the patterns slow down, partners are better able to get more deeply in touch with their vulnerabilities, needs and longings, and ask for them to be met in such a way that doesn't leave the other partner feeling criticized, threatened, abandoned, or uncared for.Some couples can do this without the help of a therapist. The book \"Hold Me Tight: 7 Conversations for a LIfetime of Love\" by Sue Johnson is a self-help book based on Emotionally Focused Therapy (the most scientifically validated couples therapy that currently exists), and has been helpful to many couples that I see. When a therapist is needed to help partners reconnect or overcome betrayals, I recommend seeking couples therapists who are trained in a scientifically tested model of couples therapy (such as Emotionally Focused Therapy. You can learn more about EFT or find an EFT therapist here: http://www.iceeft.com).To summarize:Your pain is understandable and valid. It's telling you what you are missing and what you want.Reconnection comes when we can listen to what our feelings are telling us, express those feelings in a safe way, and assert our wants/needs, while remaining open to the vulnerabilities and needs of our partner.If you can do that on your own, and your relationship is responsive, that's fantastic!

It takes courage to articulate such a painful and confusing experience. What you're describing—these intrusive, hostile thoughts that feel both familiar and foreign—sounds incredibly distressing and isolating. Please know that your feelings are valid, and this is a challenge many people face, though it can feel uniquely personal when it's happening to you.\n\nWhile I cannot provide a diagnosis here, what you're describing can be associated with several conditions, such as anxiety disorders, depression, or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), where intrusive, self-critical thoughts are common. The key feature is the *intrusive* and *ego-dystonic* nature of the thoughts—meaning they feel at odds with your true self and values, which explains why they feel so hostile and foreign.\n\nThe most important step is to consult with a mental health professional, such as a therapist or psychologist, for a proper assessment. They can provide a safe space to explore these thoughts, determine an accurate diagnosis if applicable, and create a tailored treatment plan. Effective treatments like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) are excellent for learning to relate to these thoughts differently.\n\nIn the meantime, here are a couple of practical strategies:\n1.  **Name and Normalize:** Try gently labeling the thought as it arises: \"Ah, there's the 'failure' story again.\" This creates a small but crucial distance between you and the thought.\n2.  **Practice Self-Compassion:** When the critic is loud, see if you can respond with a kinder, more factual statement to yourself, as you might to a friend. For example, \"I'm having a thought that I'm a failure, but I know I am trying my best in a difficult moment.\"\n\nYour awareness of this pattern is a powerful first step toward change.

Caring for someone who is critical and manipulative is emotionally exhausting, and creating distance is often the only healthy option left.

Her passing was the result of her own health journey, not a consequence of your boundary. To move through this guilt, I encourage you to consider a few practical steps. You might try writing a letter to your mother, expressing everything you wish you could say—the love, the hurt, the apologies, and the good memories. This can be a powerful way to externalize your emotions. Also, please consider seeking out a grief counselor or a support group for caregivers. They can provide a dedicated space to untangle these complicated emotions with professional guidance, which is highly recommended in situations like this.\n\nYour grief is real, and your need for peace is valid.

The truth is that some people cheat, and some don't, and our partners deserve the benefit of the doubt unless they show signs they can't be trusted.The answer here is in two different areas. Basically, if you want to feel differently (more trusting, in your case), you look at your thoughts, and your behaviours.Your thoughts are stuck... like tires in deep ruts in the road. These thoughts are only habits, they don't reflect the truth. Fear is probably whispering in your ear things like \"everyone cheats\", or \" you're not enough for him\".

Ask yourself what the evidence is that supports that thought (there won't be much...perhaps none), and what is the evidence that doesn't support it (I know lots of good men, I know I deserve love and loyalty, there is no sign of infidelity...).

Panic attacks are terrifying.One thing to start with is knowing that panic attacks are not going to hurt you and your anxiety will come down with time. Fighting that process can sometimes heighten symptoms because your brain wants the message of panic to be heard. Some of the best ways to counter that message is through focusing on the present moment through sensations or breathing. Taking deep breaths allows your body and brain to slow down, sending the message that there's no present danger. Focusing on the present can also send the same message, as anxiety typically throws us into the \"what ifs\" of the future. If you search google or pinterest, there are tons of methods you can use for this---some people prefer to focus on colors, shapes, smells, textures, etc., while other prefer to pay attention to internal sensations. There are also apps that can help with these techniques, such as Calm and Headspace. They work best when you aren't in a panic attack or when you feel one coming on. If you are already at the peak of an attack, they can still help, it just may take a bit longer. Some clients I have like to track their anxiety with a scale system. Let's say you scale your anxiety at an 8 out of 10, do some breathing exercises for 5 minutes, then scale it again. It's likely the anxiety decreased, at least to a 7 or 7.5. Doing this can give you some physical proof that you have some control over your body. You can also scale it without the breathing to see how it just fluctuates on its own. Anxiety will always go down and you can see that happening via numbers. This method will let you see the light at the end of the tunnel.There are other ways that might work for you via a quick google search, or through therapy.

Until you realize there is a problem you won’t start looking for a solution.Don’t misunderstand me! The abuse is not your fault! You are seeing a pattern, though, so this does need to be addressed. First, go and buy the book “Boundaries: Where You End and I Begin” by Anne Katherine. Read it. This book describes many situations that are similar to yours, describes how a person came to be that way, and how to stop it. You will have to learn to set good boundaries in your life and to maintain them.Be single for a while. Stay single until you feel like a whole, healthy, happy person on your own. Often we get in a relationship because of a need. If you feel like you need a person in your life to make you a whole person then you are in a relationship for the wrong reasons. The first step is to work on whatever it is in you that makes you feel like you need another person in your life. Identify those needs and then learn to fulfill them on your own.I was doing a couples therapy session and the husband was being emotionally abusive to the wife. This was a recurrent theme for her, like you are saying it is for you. However, she had been doing a lot of work on her own and in private therapy, and this was a new relationship. Obviously she still had not “gotten it right” because she did once again attract a man with these tendencies. The difference this time was that she had done a lot of work on herself and had become a stronger person. When she looked at him in our session and said to him “I don’t need you. I want you. But not if you are going to continue to act like this. So you leave the house and don’t come back until you are ready to make some changes.” She stuck to that, too. He didn’t leave for two more days because he kept telling her he would do different and begging to be allowed to stay. She had drawn a boundary and stuck to it, and he left. She was fully prepared to be single again. They actually did end up working things out in the end.You can’t let someone stay and continue to treat you badly. Sure, a marriage takes work and compromise on both sides. Couples therapy can help you both learn to communicate in a healthier way with each other and can help you realize what areas in the relationship need work. You may not realize how some of the things you say to him comes across, and he may not realize how what he says does to you. A therapist can help you with this so that you both learn how your words can hurt. But you need to know your boundaries and be prepared to stick to them and not compromise your boundaries. That means following through on the threat to leave when he continues to abuse you. Someone can’t do that if they are too scared to be alone. If they feel they need the other person in their life. These patterns are developed in early childhood from what we learn from our parents. When someone has grown up in a dysfunctional family, it is all they know. Even when you can say that you realize it is a problem, you still don’t know how to stop it because you never learned any other way of interacting with people. Something that took a lifetime to learn will take time and work to overcome. Be patient with yourself and find a good therapist. You can’t change your partner. Work on you, and when you begin to heal and feel healthy, the right people will come into your life and stay. The more you focus on trying to change the wrong ones to be what you want the more frustrated you will become.", "rejected": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're struggling.

Many committed couples, even those who share a strong faith and intention to wait, navigate these powerful human feelings of attraction and love. Feeling temptation and acting on it does not erase your faith, your values, or the genuine love you have for your boyfriend. The guilt you feel speaks to your deep conscience, not to a permanent failing. It's also very common to project our guilt onto the relationship itself, leading to questions like \"Is he the right one?\" as a way to make sense of the pain.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, I encourage you and your boyfriend to have a compassionate, honest conversation about what happened. This isn't about assigning blame, but about understanding each other's feelings and reaffirming your shared values moving forward. You mentioned he helped you through a dark time—that history of support is significant. Consider also seeking guidance from a trusted spiritual advisor, like a campus minister or a priest known for their pastoral counseling. They can offer you the sacramental and theological perspective specific to your Catholic faith that I, as a mental health professional, cannot.\n\nRemember, a single event does not define your entire relationship or your spiritual journey.

It's completely understandable to feel frustrated and even a bit hurt when your attempts to reconnect for support go unanswered, especially when you're taking the courageous step to resume your therapeutic work.

Your former psychologist may be on leave, experiencing a family emergency, have a full caseload, or may have changed their practice status. Their 48-hour policy typically applies to current clients, and administrative protocols for former clients can sometimes differ.

She says it's because of my anger.", "chosen": "I need help controlling my anger.Anger is like a blanket that contains other emotion from bursting out and serves as a shield to protect us when we are not able to manage external issues. Anger also helps us understand that there’s something wrong that needs to change. Once we understand that something else caused us to feel angry, then we can explore the source of anger. Ask yourself: Why am angry, Am I hurt, disappointed, confused, embarrassed etc.? Once you find the answer, explore how often that happens and what’s your reaction. Then explore how else you could respond or react. You could use I-statements as a way to communicate your true feelings to your girlfriend or whoever is involved in the scenario. This is a good exercise to practice with your Counselor or mental health provider because many unresolved issues may arise during this exploration, especially if you have been angry for a long timeAlso, it is important to understand the difference between anger and aggression and learn to manage our anger before we act on it. Anger is a feeling; aggression is when you act out your anger physically, verbally and psychologically. Find ways to vent: crying or sweating will help to release your anger, and balance the chemical response that our body creates when you become angry. Physical activity and meditation exercises can also provide a break when you manage strong emotions.Necesito ayuda para controlar mi coraje.El coraje es como una manta que cubre otras emociones evitando que se desborden y sirve como un escudo que nos protege cuando no podemos manejar problemas externos.

My partner and I are both exploring our physical connection, even though I grew up believing this should wait until marriage. My parents discovered our relationship and said I'm being led astray by someone who doesn't respect our beliefs. They've demanded I break it off, warning they'll withdraw financial support for my apartment if I continue. I feel caught between the faith I was raised with and the life I'm building. My parents say I'm living a double life and that I've chosen sin over family. I'm happy in my relationship, but their accusations—that I'm 'defying God' and 'breaking their trust'—leave me wondering if my true self is the devout son they want or the independent person I'm becoming.", "chosen": "Thank you for sharing this deeply personal and painful struggle. It takes courage to articulate the tension you're experiencing, and I want to first validate how real and difficult this is. Feeling caught between the foundational beliefs of your family and the authentic life you are building for yourself is profoundly distressing. The feelings of guilt, confusion, and fear of loss—loss of family, financial stability, and even spiritual standing—are completely understandable in this situation.\n\nWhat you're describing is a pivotal moment of identity development, which often involves integrating the values you were raised with and the values you discover for yourself. It is not necessarily a matter of one being your \"true self\" and the other being false. This is a process of synthesis, though it can feel like a撕裂 (tearing apart) right now. The pressure from your parents, including the ultimatum about financial support, adds a very concrete layer of stress to an already emotionally complex situation.\n\nAs a next step, I encourage you to create some space for gentle reflection, separate from the immediate pressure. You might ask yourself: What aspects of your faith remain meaningful to you personally? What does a respectful, loving relationship look like to you, and how does your current partnership align with that? Exploring these questions for yourself, perhaps through journaling, can provide clarity.\n\nIt is also important to consider practical safety. The threat of withdrawn financial support is significant. Could you begin to explore resources for greater independence, such as part-time work or alternative housing options, to reduce this pressure point? This isn't about rejecting your family, but about creating the emotional and practical space to make choices that are yours.\n\nFinally, I want to gently suggest that navigating this kind of family and faith transition is exactly the kind of work that ongoing counseling can support. A therapist can provide a confidential, non-judgmental space to process these conflicting loyalties and help you build a cohesive sense of self. You are not alone in this journey, and seeking support is a sign of strength, not defiance.\n\nPlease remember, your worth is not conditional on any single choice you make. You are grappling with profound human questions of love, faith, and autonomy, and that in itself is a sign of deep integrity.", "rejected": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this challenging situation.

Many people face similar dilemmas, and it's okay to question and navigate your faith and values. It's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your feelings and what truly matters to you.\n\nRegarding your parents' reaction, it's essential to acknowledge their concerns, but also recognize that their perspective might be limited by their own experiences and beliefs. Their accusations that you're 'defying God' and 'breaking their trust' might be rooted in fear, love, and a desire to protect you from what they perceive as harm.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to remember that you're an adult making your own decisions, and your choices don't necessarily reflect on your parents' values or faith.

These feelings are completely understandable, and you are not alone in this struggle.\n\nAcknowledging this pattern is your first, and most powerful, act of strength. It shows remarkable self-awareness. However, overcoming dependency is a profound challenge that is very difficult to face alone. I strongly encourage you to connect with a professional who specializes in addiction. A therapist can help you understand the roots of your urge—often tied to coping mechanisms learned early in life—and develop new strategies. Additionally, a physician can create a safe medical plan for tapering off medication, if that is part of your situation. Your safety is paramount; abruptly stopping some substances can be dangerous.\n\nFor practical steps you can take today, consider these: First, have an honest conversation with your spouse. Sharing your fears and your commitment to change can transform the strain into a source of shared support. Second, explore support groups like Nar-Anon (for families) or SMART Recovery, which can provide immediate community and practical tools. Finally, begin to identify the specific triggers for your urge. Is it stress, pain, or emotional discomfort? Start building a \"toolbox\" of alternatives for those moments—a walk, calling a friend, or a mindfulness exercise.\n\nYou have already found the strength to ask for help, which is the foundation of all change.

You are right to take these sensations seriously.\n\nFirst, I want to validate how distressing this must feel. The sensation of detachment from your body, often referred to as depersonalization, coupled with an involuntary physical response like swallowing, can be very alarming. Even though you've been informed it's not related to an existing medical condition, the impact on your well-being is real and deserves attention.\n\nGiven the physical nature of the swallowing, it is crucial to continue collaborating with medical professionals to rule out any neurological or sleep-specific causes. I would gently encourage you to consider a consultation with a sleep specialist or a neurologist, if you haven't already. They can perform assessments that are outside my scope as a counselor, ensuring all potential physiological bases are explored.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, sensations like these can sometimes be linked to periods of heightened stress, anxiety, or fatigue. While we work on understanding the root cause, we can also develop some practical coping strategies for the moment it happens. Grounding techniques can be very helpful to counter the feeling of detachment.

{"id": "counsel_00590", "prompt": "My wife and mother are having tense disagreements. In the past, they’ve had minor differences. For example, my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing; my mother would complain my wife is lazy. However, it’s intensified lately. I think the cause is my wife talked back to her once. Now, any little disagreement is magnified, leading to major disagreements. What can I do?", "chosen": "What you are describing is something psychologists have termed \"triangulation\" which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. You have been \"triangulated\" by your wife and mother.This is often seen in families. It's seen everywhere. How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. For example, I bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint.I'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. That's what therapists do every day! Sometimes just getting someone else's perspective can help you see the issue clearer. However, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love.If you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. Even if they really don't like each other and can't get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle. Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. I heard one mother-in-law describe her son's wife as the gateway to her son. The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. If your wife doesn't like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law's relationship with you and any children you two may have. From your wife's viewpoint, this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to. If you regularly praise your mom's cooking, her housework, gardening, or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated. This can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike. I am not saying that this is the case with your family's situation. These are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours. Regardless of what the cause is, if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue, your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you don't agree with them. They will get upset if you don't align yourself with them against the other. They will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other one's side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should.

He refuses to work, so he sits at home playing games all day and either lies to his mom for money or lies to his friends.

He would borrow anywhere from $5,000 to $50,000 from everyone and it would all disappear. He's in debt with bills. He doesn't gamble, but he spends his money on random stuff.

When you're in a relationship, you assume that you will continue to receive warmth and affection. When it dries up, it's a very lonely place. It's possible that there is an unaddressed issue in the relationship. It's also possible that your partner has hormonal issues, pain issues, sexual dysfunction or is asexual. There is no one answer here. Only you can decide what is right for you. But let me ask some questions to help you explore next steps:Aside from the sex, is your wife loving and supportive? What are the other ways in which you feel loved? Does your wife talk to you? Does she communicate her needs and desires? Does she articulate what gets in the way of having sex? If your wife is generally a loving, open partner, you use this to see that her behaviours aren't personal. Whether she resolves this or not, it can help you to cope with the rejection. This is your wife's issue, and the \"ball\" is in her court.In my opinion, if couple's therapy hasn't helped, it's time for your wife to own whatever is blocking her and address it with her physician and therapist. Let her be in charge of the sex for a while, to take the pressure off, and she can have the time to figure out what gets in the way of having regular sexual intimacy in your relationship. If you think of this as \"my wife is in crisis and needs support in figuring this out\", it can help you manage your own emotions. Pressure to have sex might push her further away. Did the couple therapist help you to see the dynamic in your relationship? Has your partner identified something she feels she is lacking in the relationship? One good way to make sure you \"get\" is to \"give\" (and I mean give what she wants, not sex). It's appropriate to say to her now \"I cannot live in a relationship with so little intimacy. I need for you to be honest with me about what you want for us sexually. If this is all you want, I'm not sure I can do it. If you want us to be more sexual, I need you to address what gets in the way for you.\" Give her some time, help her in any way you can, and then see where you are.

A child of any age should be listened to carefully about these matters, but just because a child has unresolved issues about a parent doesn't necessarily mean that having contact is a good solution. Some questions... Was the parent harmful to the child? Is the parent likely to be harmful to the child? How likely is it to be a positive experience? Do you have any contact with the parent? You may want to speak with the parent first to determine whether they are in a stable enough place to allow this to happen. I would start by asking the child more about what is on his mind. What does he want to get out of a visit with the parent? Is it to see them and know the parent is okay, to get an apology, to apologize for a perceived hurt, to have regular contact, to find out if they are loved...? What does he hope mom or dad might do or say in the visit? There are many possible goals this child might have in mind. This will give you a sense of what's missing for the child; what need are they trying to fill.

What you're describing—feeling trapped and using substances to cope—is an incredibly challenging and painful experience. Please know that your feelings are valid, and you are not alone in this struggle.\n\nIt's very common for individuals with bipolar II to seek relief from intense mood states, but as you've noted, alcohol and cannabis can often worsen mood instability over time and create significant secondary problems. The fact that you can see the impact on your relationships and health is a powerful first step.\n\nAs a counselor, my first concern is your safety and well-being. It is crucial to consult with a healthcare provider, ideally a psychiatrist specializing in co-occurring disorders, before making any changes. Suddenly stopping substances can be risky, and managing bipolar II requires careful, coordinated care. A professional can help you create a safe plan to address both the substance use and your mood disorder in an integrated way.\n\nFor practical steps, I encourage you to begin building a \"coping toolkit\" for when the urge to use arises. This could include simple grounding techniques like deep breathing, reaching out to a trusted friend, or engaging in a distracting activity. Keeping a brief journal to track your moods and triggers can also provide valuable insight. Most importantly, please consider connecting with a support group, such as Dual Recovery Anonymous, where you can find understanding from others walking a similar path.\n\nYou have already shown the strength to reach out.

You are asking a very good question about how to sustain a long-distance relationship. Although maintaining a long-distance relationship has its challenges, with the proper communication, commitment, and understanding, many long-distance couples are able to thrive and maintain a close connection. Without knowing more about the \"complicated\" nature of your relationship, I wonder whether your boyfriend has given you reason not to trust him that makes afraid that he will find someone else. Has he cheated on you in the past and has shown romantic interest to another person that made you fear losing him? Or, is your thought just a fear but not based on evidence? Knowing that distinction is important because if it is the latter, you may benefit from refocusing on the wonderful qualities about your partner that makes you feel good about him and the relationship rather than focusing on the unknown or uncertainty of the future. The more you focus on \"what if\" situations, the more you may feel anxious about a reality that is not accurate and make you act in ways that are insecure. However, if there is reason for you to question his fidelity, you may have to speak to your boyfriend about how to build trust in the context of a long-distance relationship. To help the conversation, you may need to consider what you may need to experience or receive as support to feel safe in the relationship to build trust. Is that you wish him to contact you regularly, or to include you more in his life, or to make a clear commitment? For many of my clients in my private practice, that may include talking to their partner often and using a variety of modalities including text, phone, and Skype.

I am now married, and my husband’s ex-girlfriend is involved with my ex-boyfriend. They also have a daughter together. My issue is that there is always drama. I am pregnant, and I told my ex-boyfriend that I don't want any drama or arguments. I want to get along as much as possible, and he agreed. However, we just had an incident where my ex-boyfriend started discussing drop-off details about my stepdaughter. I told him that he needed to ask my husband because I can't make decisions about my stepdaughter regarding the matter. That led to an argument. I told him all my concern is when I pick up my daughter. My stepdaughter’s pick-up details are between my husband and his ex-girlfriend. I especially told him I didn't want to be involved. Somehow, he turned it around and then wanted to change the schedule we agreed on. He threatened me and got ugly because I wouldn’t discuss my stepdaughter’s matters with him. The point is there is so much drama. I try my best to get along with everyone. I don't understand where I went wrong (besides replying back to his question). I feel like I'm going crazy because this is a constant battle where everyone’s frustrations are taken out on each other, and it's the children that are hurting. I had a party planned for my daughter’s birthday, and my ex-boyfriend told me to cancel those plans because he wouldn’t let me have her. In my eyes, it’s the child that is hurting. I was throwing a party for her birthday, and because of the problem with stupid pick-up details about my stepdaughter, which I have no control over, he took it out on our daughter.", "chosen": "Hi. I appreciate your mature instincts and strong efforts to draw clear boundaries in this very complex situation. I agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the children. Children need adults around them to act maturely, cooperatively and peacefully even when they don't like each other; it helps them feel secure and lets them focus on learning and growing. Your ex-boyfriend seems more focused on his own needs. In fact, he demonstrates behaviours that are aggressive, controlling and manipulative, bordering on 'parental alienation'. I agree this is a problem.I also appreciate how protective you are of yourself at this vulnerable time with the pregnancy. It's not unusual for pregnancy to trigger a need to conserve energy and reduce stress. Honour this instinct you have. I will suggest a few things to you. First, to gather support around you, professionally if you need it, from family and friends, and certainly from your husband. If you two are on the same page regarding the children issues and your ex, that will help. He can help run interference when it comes to his daughter. It will help you feel supported.Know that your ex's behaviours aren't happening because you did anything wrong; it's the way he operates (and maybe this is why you're not with him?). You can't change him, but you can stop blaming yourself for his immaturity and aggression. You're correct that he will always be there, and you can both accept this fact and also find ways to manage the situation.Keep on defining clear boundaries! You might sound like a broken record (\"You'll have to talk to my husband about that\"), but that's okay. It's okay to ignore his efforts to pull you into an argument or power struggle. It's okay to not respond to texts or other communications that aren't vitally important. It's okay to not let him into your house if it makes you uncomfortable. It's okay to not engage with him more than is necessary.Regarding his manipulative behaviours that reflect a tendency to keep your daughter from you, I recommend you document these behaviours and incidents carefully and fully. Let him know what your expectations are, simply and clearly and in writing (\"our agreement states X, and you are not following our agreement\"). Your daughter doesn't have to be aware; I think you already understand that she needs to be protected from the adult conflict.A professional therapist can help you with all of this. I hope this helps get you started towards greater peace, at least within yourself. :)", "rejected": "I can sense the frustration and concern you're feeling in this situation. It's completely understandable that you want to minimize drama and prioritize your daughter's well-being.\n\nFirstly, let's break down what's happening here. Your ex-boyfriend is trying to control the situation by bringing up an issue that you've clearly stated is not your responsibility (stepdaughter's pick-up details). He's taking a situation that you've tried to set boundaries around and turning it into a point of contention.\n\nWhen you told him you couldn't discuss the details, he escalated the situation by threatening you and becoming ugly. This behavior is not okay, and it's not your responsibility to deal with it.\n\nIn this situation, it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and the well-being of your daughter. You've already set clear boundaries, and it's not your job to convince or negotiate with him on matters that aren't yours to control.\n\nHere are some suggestions to help you navigate this situation:\n\n1.  **Reiterate your boundaries**: If your ex-boyfriend brings up the issue again, calmly and firmly remind him that you've already discussed it and agreed to not get involved in the pick-up details of your stepdaughter.

You cannot single-handedly \"prove\" your trustworthiness to someone who is unwilling to trust; that often deepens a cycle of needing to constantly prove yourself.\n\nMy primary recommendation, given the entrenched nature of this pattern, is to seek professional support. I strongly encourage you to propose couples counseling. A neutral therapist can facilitate a safer conversation where you can explain the demands of your job without it escalating into an accusation, and he can explore the roots of his insecurity. If he refuses to attend, I would suggest individual counseling for yourself. A therapist can help you establish healthy boundaries, communicate effectively under pressure, and navigate this dynamic for your own well-being.\n\nIn the immediate term, you might try a calm, scheduled conversation outside of any incident. Use \"I feel\" statements: \"I feel hurt and undermined when my professional integrity is questioned. I am committed to our marriage, and I need us to find a way to rebuild trust.\" However, please be mindful of your safety. If these accusations ever escalate into verbal intimidation, threats, or attempts to isolate you from your work, these are red flags.

Feeling powerless is something parents are wise to get used to; there's a creature in the home whose job it is to find and use their power in the family and in the world. Of course your toddler defies you, and that's healthy. I worry more about the overly compliant ones. She is wanting to know what the rules are, and all you have to do is show her clearly where the lines are. I'll give you some tips.First, remind yourself that it's her job to learn what the rules are, and where her power is. Don't be so surprised when she wants it her way. If we go through our days being ready and prepared for these beautiful creatures to have minds of their own, we're less caught off guard when it happens. Avoid situations that invite power struggles. Any time you tell your daughter \"do this now\", you set up a power struggle. The good thing is that she's young enough you can pick her up; now is the time to teach her that mom's (or dad's) word means something. So, if you say \"let's get you dressed\", then be prepared to pick her up right away and show her that when you say something will happen, you can make it happen. And I'm talking about gently picking her up here...not roughly. Pick your battles; only give instructions when you have the power to make it happen.Give her choices, so she can see her power. Instead of opening her drawer and asking what she wants to wear, give her two choices. Here's an example...she's on the ipad and you say ipad time is over. She says \"no\". You can say \"ipad time is over. If you put it down, you can play later. If I have to take it away, you don't play it later.\" The choice is hers. Then follow through.\"When...then\" statements are really helpful. Your child asks for something. Instead of saying no, try \"as soon as the toys are picked up, we can have a snack\". You're simply a pleasant parent who wants the same thing they do...but they have to earn it. Staying calm yourself is the key, because then at least you will feel in control of yourself, which is the ultimate goal. Use self-talk to calm yourself. Remind yourself her behaviour is normal and healthy. Breathe through a moment in which you would have reacted, and it will be over by the time the breath is done. You can give yourself time to think before you make parenting decisions. Time is a useful tool not enough parents use. Good luck!", "rejected": "I can provide some suggestions on how to navigate this situation. Here are a few strategies that might be helpful:\n\n1.  **Model the behavior you want to see in your child. Children often learn by observing the adults around them, so if you want your child to be more respectful and compliant, try to model that behavior yourself. Speak calmly and assertively, and make sure your words and actions are clear and consistent.\n2.  Use positive language and avoid yelling or punishing your child for not listening. Positive reinforcement can be a powerful tool in shaping behavior, so try to focus on praising your child when they do something right, rather than punishing them when they do something wrong.\n3.  A good way to encourage your child to listen to you is to make it a game. You can say something like, \"I need your help with something. Can you help me do this?\" or \"I need your help to get this done.\" This makes it a team effort and makes your child feel more invested in the outcome.\n4.  Set clear boundaries and expectations.

The warmth and connection you felt in those family gatherings are a testament to the love she helped cultivate, and it's natural that their absence now creates a profound sense of sadness and quiet. Please know that holding both the beauty of those memories and the pain of their loss is a sign of how much she and those times meant to you.\n\nHonoring those memories while engaging with the present is a delicate balance, and it's something we can work on together. One approach is to consider creating a dedicated \"memory time\" in your day. For a few minutes, allow yourself to fully immerse in one of those warm recollections. Then, gently transition by asking yourself, \"What is one small thing I can appreciate or notice right now?\" It could be the sunlight in the room, a comforting taste, or a simple task. This isn't about replacing the past, but about training your mind to also register goodness in the present moment.\n\nYou might also find meaning in a concrete act of honor—perhaps preparing her favorite recipe, sharing stories with another family member, or volunteering with an organization she cared about. These actions can bridge the past and present, carrying her values forward.\n\nGrief has its own timeline, and if you find the sadness persistently overwhelming or isolating, seeking additional support from a grief counselor or support group can be incredibly beneficial. You don't have to navigate this alone. Your desire to both honor your grandmother and find appreciation in your current life is a courageous and healthy intention.

It's okay to feel sad, but also be kind to yourself and don't let guilt or regret consume you.\n\n2.  **Celebrate the memories**: Think about the happy times and the lessons learned from those gatherings. Celebrate the love and connection you shared with your grandmother and the impact she had on your life.\n\n3.  **Create a memory book or scrapbook**: Gather photos and mementos from your grandmother's life and create a book or scrapbook to honor her memory. This can be a way to keep her close and to reflect on the good times.\n\n4.  **Reach out to others who share similar experiences**: Connect with others who have experienced a similar loss and share their stories.

You are clearly a resourceful young person to reach out like this to find help. Good for you. I have a few ideas and perhaps some other counselors will add some thoughts, too. First, good for you for taking care of yourself and making really good decisions – such as not getting into the car with dad when he is intoxicated. It is really important that you consider your safety above all else. To answer your heading question, yes, it is quite common for people to blame themselves for other people’s actions. There are various reasons why we do this. For one thing, someone may tell us that their behaviors are our fault. And depending on things like our relationship to that person, past experiences, and our self-esteem, we may actually start to believe it. What is important to remember is that your parents have the responsibility to be sure that you are safe and cared for, not the other way around. As for the other things you mentioned, I am concerned about both your physical and emotional safety and well-being. It sounds like your father has an alcohol abuse problem, and living with someone who is struggling with addiction can be hard for anyone, let alone a teenager who is also trying to deal with things like school. You may want to see if your school has a counselor or someone you can talk to about what is going on. I will tell you that in some states, what you have told me may be something that a counselor would have to report to child protection services, but not necessarily. If you are concerned about that, ask the counselor what they are obligated to report. If you don’t know a counselor, think about any other adult that you would feel comfortable talking to. They may have some ideas. Sometimes individual states have non-profit chat lines or hotlines for teens to call if they are struggling with things. You may be able to find something like that in your state. I do warn your about doing random searches, not every website is good, so be careful. This is clearly a tough spot for you to be in, so one of the things that I encourage you to do while searching for support is to focus on taking care of yourself. Sometimes things like this can really bring us down and we stop doing the things we enjoy. Try really hard not to let that happen. If you have interests, do them. If you catch yourself thinking too hard about things, try to find something fun to do to distract yourself. Try to take care of yourself in other ways, such as eating well. Exercise can really help when we get stressed. I hope some of this was helpful. Good luck. Robin J.

Ask your partner what's up with accusations or assumptions.The third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating.

What values or feelings arise when I connect with this belief?\" Practices like contemplative meditation, journaling, or spending time in nature can help you connect with a sense of meaning that feels genuine to you, separate from external narratives.\n\nIt's also okay to sit with the \"not knowing.\" You don't have to resolve this today. This process takes time and patience with yourself.

This is a new term for me... \"semi-relationship\". What does it mean? I know that today's culture for young people is more of a \"hook-up\" culture than a dating one. Maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore. That makes me feel sad. I hear a lot of young women (I'm not sure you're female, but that's my guess) say that they struggle with hook-ups because they can't let themselves hope for a phone call after a hook-up.

I truly wish I could give you some things to say to them that would change their reaction, but unfortunately I can't do that. Their acceptance of you is a journey, just like coming out is a journey for you. Sometimes families initially respond this way, but after time they become more accepting and even supportive. Unfortunately, there is no way to know for sure if that will happen. So, here are a few things I would suggest:Surround yourself with people and things that remind you that you really are okay as you are. That won't take the place of your family's acceptance, and I won't even pretend that it would, but it may help during those days when it hurts the most. And that is really important. Patience is not something that many of us are really good at, but this type of situation sometimes forces you to have some. When families first learn something like this, they may go through a period of shock. And then sometimes even grieving. They may even be worried if they are of a particular religion where being bisexual is forbidden. These things can take time for them to reconcile, so it may just take some patience. If it is safe for you, try to talk to them, but if it becomes painful or hurtful then you have the right to walk away. I do recommend setting up some personal boundaries for yourself, and perhaps learn some assertiveness skills if you feel you struggle with them. The reason I feel that this is important is that people sometimes take a lot of abuse from family members and friends in times like you're describing. They may want to be accepted so much that they put themselves in hurtful positions over and over again hoping that their families will come around. They may, or they may not. And if they don't, you deserve to live a life free of abuse and to feel confident and assured of who you are. To be surrounded by folks who remind you of that.

Trauma and grief can affect us in many ways, and certainly deeply personal things like our sex lives. It may be difficult for others to make the connection, but it is there. So, for example, if stress and trauma make you feel like you are not interested in sex, a partner may take it as a personal rejection rather than response to stress, trauma or grief.

We told each other that we loved each other all the time, even while we were making love. A few days after Thanksgiving, she told me that we would have to go back to her original plans of seeing each other much less frequently. I was very hurt and didn’t understand. Then another week later, she told me she couldn’t do it at all anymore. I was crushed! A few days later, she tells me how much she’s missing me and “let’s get together for lunch” or something like that. Then about two weeks later, we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other (in love, not just sex), but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her. So for her child’s sake, she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen. She had told me all about him previously, and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him, but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child. Our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged, but she is torn and confused. She doesn’t even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly. I know she needs time, and all I can do is take care of myself.

The cravings are one thing, but my mind just keeps circling back to it, especially when I'm stressed. How can I break this mental habit?", "chosen": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes a lot of courage and foresight to recognize the need for a change like this, especially during what can be an exciting yet stressful time as you plan for a family. What you're describing is completely understandable—nicotine addiction has both a powerful physical component and a deeply ingrained mental one. The fact that your mind circles back to vaping, particularly under stress, highlights how it has become a default coping mechanism. It's important to be gentle with yourself as you work to rewire that habit.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that while I can offer strategies, a healthcare provider can give you personalized medical advice on cessation methods that are safe while trying to conceive. Consulting your doctor is a very important first step.\n\nOn the practical side, let's address that mental loop. When a craving hits, especially during stress, the key is to disrupt the pattern. Start by simply noticing the thought without judgment: \"Ah, there's my mind going to the vape again.\" Then, consciously insert a new, healthy action. This could be taking five deep breaths, drinking a glass of cold water, or stepping outside for a minute. The goal is to create a \"pause\" between the urge and any action.\n\nSimultaneously, we need to build new stress-management tools. Could you introduce a brief daily mindfulness practice, even five minutes, to help calm the overall mental chatter? Also, openly discussing this struggle with your partner can help them provide support and distraction when cravings are strong.\n\nRemember, relapse can be part of the process. If you slip, please don't see it as a failure, but as information. What triggered it? How can you adjust your plan?

Is it when you're stressed, bored, or around certain people? Knowing your triggers can help you prepare for those situations and develop coping mechanisms.\n2.  **Find alternative coping mechanisms:** Engage in activities that help you relax and manage stress, such as yoga, meditation, reading, or exercise.

It takes great courage to come to this self-understanding, and it's completely understandable to feel trapped, scared, and heartbroken by this potential conflict. Your feelings are valid.\n\nFirst, I want to emphasize that your safety is the top priority. Please consider: if you were to share this with your family, is there a risk of immediate harm, being forced to leave home, or being cut off financially? If so, creating a safety plan—which could include securing important documents, having a safe place to stay, and building a support network outside the family—becomes the essential first step. Your well-being must come first.\n\nWhen the time feels right for disclosure, that process is deeply personal. You are not obligated to tell anyone until you feel ready and secure. You might consider starting with the family member you feel might be most receptive, or by sharing in a written format that allows you to express your full thoughts without interruption. Remember, their initial reaction may not be their final one; understanding can take time, though this is not guaranteed.\n\nIt is crucial to build your own circle of support during this time.

Your cousin being found confused, undressed, and in danger due to exposure is a serious safety crisis. In a situation like this, where someone is a clear danger to themselves due to a mental health condition, you do have options to seek emergency intervention.

A personal relationship with a coworker adds layers of complexity, and his current behavior—name-calling and demanding payment for a decision he made alone—crosses professional and personal lines. His suggestion that you take on side gigs is inappropriate and adds undue pressure.

I agree with Sherry that being patient with yourself is important. Here are a few things I would suggest:1. Get clear on the behaviors you really want to change, and make sure they are behaviors that CAN be changed. Sometimes we will set a goal like, \"I want to be more confident\" but that is hard to measure and prove to yourself that you accomplished it. Saying you are going to accept a date or go on a job interview is something you can actually do, and something that you may consider to be demonstrating confidence. Whatever your change of behavior is, make sure it is something you can actually change. 2. If you are going to give up a behavior, decide what you are going to do in place of it. So, if you are going to stop showing up late for work, then you are deciding to be on time for work and demonstrating your value of being punctual. 3. If you are going to make changes, really nail down WHY you want to make them. What is it about making these changes that is important to you as a person? For example, if you have the goal of weight loss, the reason this is important to you as a person may be because you value self-care. Knowing WHY you want to make changes is both your motivation and your compass for getting there. 4. Once you know WHY you want to make these changes, I strongly suggest setting small goals. If you set too high of goals you may not accomplish them and just feel worse. So, make the goal small, realistic, and guided by the the things you want to be as a person. 5. As Sherry mentioned, finding a counselor is sometimes a good idea if you really feel stuck. Any counselor who does work with goal-setting and motivation can probably help.

Without a clear vision, it's hard to make progress towards a specific goal. Try to identify what's holding you back and what you want to achieve.\n2.  **Fear of failure**: Fear of failure can be a significant obstacle to change. You might be afraid of the unknown consequences of your decisions or the possibility of not succeeding. This fear might be holding you back from making any changes.\n3.  **Comfort zone**: You might be comfortable with your current situation, even if it's not ideal. This is known as the \"comfort zone.\" You might be hesitant to leave your comfort zone, even if it's holding you back.\n4.  **Lack of motivation**: You might not be motivated enough to make the changes you want.

It takes courage to voice something that carries so much shame and confusion. First, I want to offer you a space of complete non-judgment.

Many children, driven by natural curiosity about their bodies, engage in some form of exploratory play. It’s important to understand that children do not have the cognitive or emotional framework of adults; they operate from a place of discovery, not the complex moral and social understandings we develop later.\n\nThe shame and confusion you're feeling now as an adult are completely valid.

It's clear you're considering the client's well-being deeply, which is at the heart of ethical practice. Navigating the conclusion of therapy is a significant responsibility, and feeling reflective about it is completely understandable.\n\nSeveral key factors should guide this decision, ideally as a collaborative process between you and the client. Primarily, we look at whether the original goals for therapy have been met. Has the client made meaningful progress toward the objectives you set together? Another crucial indicator is the client's increased sense of self-efficacy—do they feel more capable of handling life's challenges using the tools and insights gained in sessions? The therapeutic relationship itself is also a barometer; a natural sense of closure and a shift in the dynamic can signal readiness.\n\nIt's also essential to consider practical factors like sustained progress over time, not just temporary relief, and any external changes (like a move or financial shift) that may necessitate an adjustment. However, we must always be mindful of our own boundaries and competencies. If a client's needs have evolved beyond your scope of practice, a referral is the most ethical choice.\n\nMost importantly, this should never be an abrupt termination. We must proactively discuss and plan for the ending, processing the client's feelings about it and collaboratively creating a maintenance and relapse prevention plan. If there are any ongoing safety concerns, such as risk of harm to self or others, these must be thoroughly addressed and stabilized, with clear crisis resources in place, before concluding.\n\nThis transition is a profound phase of the work.

It takes a great deal of self-awareness to recognize this pattern, and I want to acknowledge the courage it took to voice it. Feeling the need to build emotional barriers and push people away is often a sign that you've been hurt or felt vulnerable in the past. It's a protective mechanism, and your mind is trying to keep you safe, even if it now feels isolating.\n\nWhat you're describing is a common challenge, and it's something we can work through.

It takes a great deal of courage to articulate this cycle, and I want you to know that your feelings of exhaustion and frustration are completely valid. What you're describing—using food to cope with difficult emotions like anxiety and loneliness, followed by compensatory exercise driven by guilt—is a deeply painful and common pattern. You are not alone in this struggle, and it's important to recognize that this is not a failure of willpower, but a sign that you are trying to manage very real emotional pain.\n\nFirst, I want to gently address the safety aspect of this cycle. The combination of binge eating and compensatory behaviors, like punishing exercise, can be harmful to both your physical and mental health. It is crucial to consider speaking with a healthcare provider and a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. They can provide a comprehensive assessment and support tailored specifically to you, which is essential for sustainable recovery. As a counselor, I must emphasize that while I can offer guidance, ongoing professional support is key for addressing the root causes of this pattern.\n\nOn a practical level, we can begin to disrupt this cycle by introducing small, compassionate pauses. When you feel anxiety or loneliness rising, could you experiment with a different, gentle action before turning to food? This might be writing down three things you're feeling, stepping outside for five minutes of fresh air, or calling a trusted friend. The goal isn't to \"fix\" the feeling immediately, but to create space between the emotion and the action. Similarly, after a binge, practice responding with curiosity instead of punishment. Ask yourself, \"What was that food trying to soothe?\" This shifts the focus from shame to understanding. Replacing the punishing run with a kind activity, like a warm bath or listening to calming music, can help break the association between food and punishment.\n\nHealing from this cycle is a journey of replacing judgment with self-compassion.

The first thing I wonder is what age you are. At different transitions and stages in life, it's really common for anxieties to come out of the woodwork. First time this takes place at a greater level is during adolescence, because a teen's \"job\" is to figure out who they are within the context of other people. Spikes in anxiety also can also occur after high school when you are leaving the nest and heading to college, or the late twenties when it feels like you are expected to have your life figured out and compare to where others are in their lives. That same scenario can show up in mid-life as well for different reasons depending on the person. Aside from age, certain circumstances can influence a jump in anxiety, such as a job change, switching schools, moving, opening a business, college finals, etc. Take some time to explore where the anxiety might be coming from and just see what comes up. It may be something you have some control over, or something that you can ask for help from someone else for--especially if it's social anxiety. The more you practice social skills, the more confidence you'll have in the long-run.A metaphor I use with some people is gas for a car. Anxiety is a necessary motivator for action, though you get to decide where to go with that anxiety. An overfilled tank doesn't get you any further than a normally-filled tank, and more gas doesn't mean the gas is in charge of where you go. Applying that to what I know about your situation--how much of that worrying is getting you somewhere, how much is just extra gas, and are the worries changing what you really want to do?

It takes a lot of self-awareness to recognize this dynamic, and I want to validate that your experience of feeling others' stress and physical sensations so intensely is very real and can be exhausting.\n\nTo answer your specific question: while the term \"empath\" is not a formal clinical diagnosis, the experience you're describing is well-recogned in mental health fields. It often relates to traits of high sensory processing sensitivity and profound empathy, which can be innate strengths. However, when it leads to significant distress or impairment—as it seems to be doing for you—it can overlap with clinically relevant concepts.

I strongly encourage you to seek a consultation with a therapist. They can help you build essential skills, such as grounding techniques to distinguish your own emotions from others', setting healthy emotional boundaries, and practicing self-compassion.

This dual desire—to protect your own heart while helping him heal—is a testament to your care for him and your relationship.\n\nWhat you're describing is a common, yet painful, dynamic where one person's unresolved guilt can manifest as criticism of others.

The work of self-forgiveness is ultimately his to do.\n\nA practical first step could be to initiate a calm, non-defensive conversation at a neutral time. Using \"I feel\" statements, you might express how his fixation creates distance, and gently reflect that his intensity seems connected to his own pain. You could ask, \"How can we, as partners, create a space where we both feel we can move forward from our pasts?\" Exploring this together may open a door.\n\nGiven the devout background you both share, it might be supportive to discuss if re-engaging with your faith in a new, compassionate way could be helpful—perhaps through study, prayer, or speaking with a progressive or well-regarded religious leader who emphasizes mercy and renewal over punishment.\n\nHowever, if his judgment continues to feel punishing or creates an unsafe emotional environment for you, it is crucial to prioritize your own well-being. I strongly encourage you both to consider seeking a couples counselor, preferably one with cultural and religious competency.

Some research outlines that our fear of public speaking is greater than our fear of death. That's hefty! Shame is often the culprit for social anxiety because we think other people will see the flaws in ourselves that we believe are there.

Confidence can be easy to fake if it's how you cope with fear.To work through some of that, it's much better to force yourself out there and have conversations.

I can hear how hurt and confused you are by this situation, and I want to start by validating that. Having key parts of a project you're leading reassigned can feel deeply undermining, and it's a very natural human reaction to seek clarity about the reasons behind it. Your question to your manager was a reasonable attempt to understand your professional standing, and being told you were \"overly sensitive\" or \"seeking too much validation\" likely compounded the hurt, making you feel dismissed.

When suspicion and insecurity come along, your job is to look at the big picture and the real picture. Is there any real evidence that he is cheating? Remember that texting his ex is not evidence alone if the communications are about the kids. Has he earned your trust? If so, then it's not fair to punish him for the betrayals of others. He's not your ex. Reassure your heart that you are his priority if the larger evidence supports that. At the same time, you can let him know what your triggers are.

Coupled with this is **congruence**, or authenticity, where you are real and transparent within the therapeutic relationship.\n\nProfessionally, critical abilities include **active listening**—hearing not just the words but the meanings and emotions behind them—and **effective communication** to reflect and clarify. **Cultural humility** is indispensable; it’s the commitment to understanding your own biases and respectfully learning about a client’s unique background. Furthermore, strong **ethical reasoning** and the ability to maintain clear, healthy boundaries are non-negotiable for creating a safe, trustworthy environment.\n\nIt’s also vital to recognize that these skills are developed over a lifetime of practice, supervision, and self-reflection.

Please know that your care for your sister, and your desire to understand what happened, speaks to your love for her.\n\nFrom a professional counseling standpoint, the issue of confidentiality is central here. In the United States, and in many other countries, addiction treatment is protected by strict federal confidentiality laws (42 CFR Part 2), which are even more stringent than general health privacy laws. These laws generally prohibit a treatment program from disclosing any patient information—including attendance, progress, or relapse—without the patient's explicit written consent. The ethical intent is to build a foundation of trust between the client and clinician, which is essential for recovery. Unless your sister had provided written permission for the clinic to speak with you, the counselors were legally bound to maintain her confidentiality, even in the face of a relapse.\n\nRegarding legal consequences, this typically centers on whether the clinic adhered to these confidentiality laws and their own standard of care *for their patient*. Their legal duty was to your sister, not to the family, within those confidentiality constraints. However, the specifics of your situation matter greatly.

What this means is if you were to feel your emotions related to your rape, you would have a sense of being overwhelmed, possibly re-experiencing the traumatic event.Not feeling emotions is your body's way of protecting you from any further trauma. Unfortunately, when the (parasympathetic) dorsal vagal system (shutting down feeling) is activated and suppresses your painful emotions (pain, shame, guilt, sadness, anger), it also shuts down your positive and relational emotions (love, joy, contentment, connectedness, happiness).I am very sorry that you had to go through such a traumatic experience as being raped.

I was wondering how I can ask my psychologist to up the dose to 1 mg twice a day without her thinking I'm abusing them. I just have very big anxiety attacks. Should I stay on the 0.5mg and deal with the attacks or should I ask to up the dose? I'm afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else.", "chosen": "It seems like what you are looking for is a way to advocate for yourself and that's so important in mental health! You know best what is working for you and what isn't, so you are the best person to speak out for yourself to the people that can help you. I have extensive training in substance abuse and medications used in therapy, and I work with many people that take Xanax. Counselors may not prescribe, but with the right training we can educate and help you move through the complexities of medication usage when paired with therapy. There's definitely some debate about using medication in the counseling world, but many people are prescribed Xanax to cope with big emotional responses. We don't know much about your situation here--if you are in counseling, what types of other coping skills you've tried to use, etc., so it'd be hard to suggest not taking anything for your symptoms. You are obviously struggling and sometimes stabilization is the best you can do. And the fact that you are considering dealing with the attacks as an option is a sign you are willing to negotiate your dosage and maybe even the intense fear you are experiencing. That's seriously so courageous.A little bit about Xanax--Xanax is a drug in the Benzodiazepine family and is fast-acting. That means it does only help short-term, but your body also builds a tolerance to it pretty quickly (just as people build tolerance to alcohol). That could be why they aren't as effective for you at the dosage you are taking, especially if you are prescribed to take them twice a day. It's really important that you discuss the symptoms you are still having with your prescribing provider, as well as when you are taking the medications so they understand the details of your situation and can determine if or how to modify your dosage. These providers know a lot about the medication process and the more info they have, the better they can meet your needs. They are ultimately the ones that will work with you to decide whether or not Xanax is the best for you and your situation.I definitely understand your concern that your provider may basically take away how you cope with panic attacks. That's a scary thought! Prescribing providers are typically trained in detecting medication abuse, and it is very common for people with anxiety issues to request higher dosages. I have had plenty of clients ask for increased dosage. Not only can this get you the assistance you need at the time you need it, but give you a voice in your treatment. You may end up using that same voice for request to lower your dosage in the future.I do feel an ethical duty to let you know about some of the dangers of Xanax. Benzodiazepines are depressants and work on the central nervous system (CNS) to do things like slow down your heart rate, breathing, etc. (as you can feel when they do work). They should never be taken with any other depressants, such as alcohol, barbiturates, and other medications in the Benzo family. Combinations like these could be fatal.Another danger is that there's a common pattern of relapse after discontinuing Xanax. This means that symptoms tend to come back stronger than they were before taking the drug. The reason for this is because when you are taking Xanax, your brain tries to intensify your fear reaction to override the drug. So when you discontinue it, your fear reactions are still at those heightened levels. Your prescribing provider can talk to you more about that and/or the process of tapering off the medication to make that less likely when that time comes for you.If you are in counseling and doing exposure activities, (being exposed to things you fear and sitting through the anxiety response) Xanax does interfere with this process. The brain can't learn a different response if you feel calm. This is something your counselor (if you have one) can discuss with you as well.The last thing I'd like to say is that there could be some value to practicing other ways to manage your anxiety if you want to make more long-term changes. That decision is completely yours! If/when you feel ready to do that, a counselor can help you learn how to move through anxiety without being as reliant on Xanax. I hope this is helpful and you find what you need!", "rejected": "I can't advise you on how to ask your psychologist to up your dosage or what you should do.

It shows a great deal of self-awareness and professional commitment to be thinking about the challenges inherent in the counseling relationship. It's completely normal and expected for mental health professionals to encounter obstacles in their work—it's a deeply human process, and navigating human dynamics is complex.\n\nSome common obstacles include managing **transference and countertransference**, where a client's feelings about significant people in their life get directed toward you, or where your own personal experiences are triggered by a client's material. This requires constant self-reflection and supervision. **Establishing and maintaining clear boundaries** is another frequent challenge, whether it's around time, communication outside sessions, or the appropriate level of self-disclosure. Professionals may also face **compassion fatigue or burnout** from consistently holding space for others' pain, which can lead to emotional exhaustion if not managed.\n\nTo navigate these obstacles, I strongly encourage a proactive approach. Regular **clinical supervision or consultation** is not just beneficial; it's essential for ethical practice. It provides a safe space to process these challenges. Prioritizing your own **self-care and personal therapy** is equally critical—you cannot pour from an empty cup. Furthermore, continually engaging in **professional development** can help you feel more equipped and confident when these obstacles arise.\n\nRemember, encountering these hurdles doesn't mean you're failing; it means you're engaged in the real, demanding, and rewarding work of counseling.

The dynamics of having a romantic relationship with someone is not always clear. Sometimes we jump from one relationship to another without giving ourselves a chance to adjust and grieve for the one we had to leave behind.

One thing I wonder is did you volunteer the information about your past or is this something that he asked about? In the future, it is probably best to leave details out of conversations like this. I think it is common and natural for partners to ask about the sexual history. For one thing, it is a good idea to be checked for STD’s before entering into a sexual relationship with someone, and it is fair to share that information with each other. Partners usually want to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you have or if there is anything you don’t like to do. This gets into a gray area for some people. I don’t necessarily want to know how many people my partner has been with and I certainly don’t want a whole lot of details. Sometimes that is an image I just don’t want in my head about my partner. Vague details are usually enough.However, I understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past. This is a reflection on him, not you. This shows insecurities on his part. You cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information. The past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future. If he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship. You can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you. I have seen relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity. It takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though. If your boyfriend cannot get over your past, you may have to let him go. Don’t keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you. Constantly holding your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low self-esteem due to this type of treatment. I don’t see that you have done anything wrong. If you aren’t cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your past honestly, how he handles that information is on him. Ultimately, relationships have a tendency to come and go. Don’t fight to hold onto someone who is not right for you. It is okay to be single and enjoy being the best you that you can be.

When you notice this pattern, what thoughts come up for you? Do you find yourself questioning your own worth, or feeling like you have to earn friendship through constant effort? Often, we can fall into patterns where we over-function in relationships, sometimes without even realizing it.

First, try a compassionate \"pause.\" Instead of initiating plans or check-ins for a set period, observe what happens. This isn't a test or a punishment, but a way to gather information about the natural flow of these friendships. Second, when you do reconnect, you could use \"I feel\" statements to express your needs in a low-confrontational way.

When I think about what happened, I feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me.", "chosen": "Hello, and thank you for your question. Guilt is one of those things that nearly everyone has experienced at one time or another, and it can feel like a huge weight around your neck. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that we can give you some words of wisdom that will make it all go away. However, I will give you some ideas and hopefully this will help.One of the things that we know about guilt is that it doesn't usually do much to help us in the long-run. People may make changes for a short-term period of time because they feel guilty about something they did, but usually they will go back to their old behaviors if they don't have something else to help them change permanently, such as a new skill. So, guilt doesn't necessarily help us. In fact, as I write this someone out there is eating an entire key lime pie because they feel guilty about falling off their diet. Someone may be drinking alcohol because they feel guilty about drinking alcohol. For whatever reason, this is just a common thing that we do. Now accountability is different than guilt. Accountability can actually be constructive. When you hold yourself accountable you can admit that you have done something wrong. That it hurt others and you deeply regret it. That you are prepared to take steps to make sure it doesn't happen again. That you have done what you can to make amends, if necessary. That you are sorry. And then you move on. Why is moving on necessary? Well, for one thing, it doesn't usually help the people who you hurt. In fact, someone's guilty behavior may serve to remind the people who were hurt, over and over again, about what happened. Guilt is usually 100% about us, and not about those we hurt. Also, guilt can lead us to behave in ways that may even hurt people more. Having said all of that, guilt is a normal human emotion. Sometimes we experience it for a while and it goes away. Sometimes we need help to work through it. There are many self-help books about forgiving yourself. You can try Amazon to find some, or consider getting help from a counselor.

It is deeply discouraging and painful when the connections we value with family don't feel reciprocated in the way we hope. That sense of caring more, or investing more effort, can lead to feelings of loneliness, rejection, and grief, even within a family unit. Your feelings are completely valid and understandable.\n\nWhat you're describing touches on a fundamental human need for secure attachment and belonging. When that feels unstable with family, it can shake our foundation. It's important to first acknowledge this hurt without judgment toward yourself. You might gently explore the expectations and hopes you have for these relationships. Sometimes, differing capacities for connection—stemming from their own life stresses, emotional histories, or personal challenges—can drive this dynamic, though it never makes the sting less real.\n\nAs a starting point for coping, I encourage you to focus on what is within your control.

It is difficult to know what happened with your sister with the limited information you have provided, but what I suspect is that there are some unresolved issues between the two of you and that she may be projecting her pain on to you. It is important to remember that your sister is also grieving the loss of your mother and may not be dealing with it in a very healthy way. By her bringing up your relationship with your mother and suggesting that you were \"never close\" to her is her opinion. Only you can define and determine what your relationship was like with your mother. If there is truth to this, then it may be something you may need to talk about with a counselor. There could be an added layer of ambiguous loss in that you are not only grieving her physical absence, but could be grieving the loss of a relationship you wish you could have had with her and the realization that you never will. You and your sister are both in the heart of the grieving cycle. When two people are grieving the same loss at the same time, it is difficult to provide support to each other because of their own struggle, even if they both were on good terms with each other. Depression is part of the cycle of grief. It is absolutely normal to feel sad, as well as experiencing other depressive symptoms (i.e., feelings of isolation, lack of motivation, low energy, sleep or appetite changes, etc.). Anger is another phase of the grief cycle. Your sister may be stuck in the anger phase, not wanting to connect with her own feelings of sadness, so this may be why she is being hurtful towards you, in projecting her anger onto you in order to avoid the vulnerability of experiencing her own grief.Finally, it appears that your depression proceeded the loss of your mother and is making your experience with grief more complicated. Were you officially diagnosed and treated for depression prior to your loss? Depression in grief is different than a depressive mood disorder. Depression can be situational (i.e., triggered by an event) or related to genetics, undiagnosed health issues, stress, trauma or other potential risk factors. If you have a family history of depression, you are more susceptible to have depression. It would be wise for you to discuss this with a mental health provider, and if necessary, get treatment through counseling and medical interventions.", "rejected": "I'm so sorry to hear about your loss and your difficult relationship with your sister.

How does substance abuse change a person's mindset and personality?", "chosen": "Thank you for reaching out and sharing this deeply painful and concerning situation. It's completely understandable to feel hurt, confused, and worried after a sudden breakup, especially when compounded by concerns about your ex's well-being and the honesty in your relationship. Your care for them, even now, speaks volumes.\n\nTo address your question directly: yes, it is possible that the sudden withdrawal, the breakup, and the discovered untruths are connected to a relapse. Substance use, particularly with opioids like heroin, profoundly alters brain chemistry. It can create a powerful drive to prioritize obtaining and using the substance above all else—including important relationships and personal integrity. This often leads to secrecy, isolation, and drastic changes in behavior as the individual becomes consumed by the addiction cycle. The person you knew can seem overshadowed by the addiction's demands, which can manifest as personality shifts, emotional withdrawal, and broken trust.\n\nMy primary concern in this situation is for your own emotional safety and stability. While your care for your ex is clear, you cannot control their choices or recovery. The most supportive and healthy step you can take is to firmly focus on your own healing. This breakup is a significant loss, and the deception adds another layer of hurt. I strongly encourage you to seek support for yourself, perhaps through a therapist or a support group like Al-Anon or Nar-Anon, which are specifically for families and friends affected by a loved one's addiction. These spaces can provide invaluable understanding and coping strategies.\n\nPlease remember that you are not responsible for their addiction or their recovery.

First, I want you to know that you are certainly not alone on this issue. Everyone, at some point in time, has a fear of public embarrassment. But for many people, this fear can become so awful that it begins to have a real negative impact on their quality of life. They will try to avoid any situation that they even THINK will cause them embarrassment or anxiety. Escaping a possible embarrassing moment by avoiding or isolating may cause some relief at first, but then many times the avoidance will eventually lead to loneliness, isolation, and even despair. By avoiding, we can also miss out on things that make us feel alive and bring enjoyment. There are many self-help books that offer advice on this issue. You can do an internet search, and I recommend reading the reviews of the book. That is great way to find out if others have found the book helpful. Another option is to seek a counselor to help you with this fear. I would recommend a counselor who specializes in helping people who have anxiety or social anxiety. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is a good choice for helping with anxiety, but there are many others.

Wow, this sounds like a sticky situation; however, I’m here to help guide you through this decision. First and foremost, you must ask yourself, if you ever loved your sons’ father or was it a situation to where you two got pregnant and stayed together for the child. It’s very common to stay with your partner when a child is involved regardless, if love is involved or not because “it’s the right thing to do.” Right? Well, not entirely. Although, staying with your partner because you have a child together may seem right, in fact, it hurts the child in the long run. If you are not love with your partner, you will show distance, unhappiness, sadness, possibility of frequent arguments and cheating. When a child grows up in the home and witnesses these types of emotions & behaviors it is unhealthy as he/she will expect their own relationships to be such. As a responsible adult, you are supposed to be there to shape and model the future for your child. Just remember, what you do, your child will model. Secondly, do not sell yourself short from love. Everyone deserves to be happy and to have someone to share their love and intimacy with. However, being in love with someone you have never seen before can be very risky. Honestly, that sounds like lust and the longing of love. Humans have needs and when people are unhappy in their current relationship, they often seek out what they need. If you decide to pursue the second relationship, I would suggest setting up an outing with a friend or two in order to get to know this person as there are a lot of scammers these days. Finally, I am not convinced that this has anything to do with choosing between two guys. This seems as if you are making a decision to end the relationship with your child’s father or not. You should ask yourself, if you were in love with your child’s father first off. If you were, you would have never sought after love.

It takes immense courage to acknowledge the struggle you're facing, especially while managing bipolar II. What you're describing—feeling helpless and seeing the harm yet feeling unable to stop—is a profoundly difficult and painful place to be. Please know that your feelings are completely valid, and you are not alone in this experience. Many people with bipolar disorder find that substances can initially feel like a way to cope, only to later realize they are creating more problems.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to acknowledge the complexity of your situation. When bipolar disorder and substance dependence occur together, each condition can worsen the other, making it incredibly challenging to break the cycle alone. This is not a sign of weakness, but rather an indication that you are dealing with two interconnected health conditions that require professional, integrated treatment.\n\nGiven this, the most critical step I can recommend is to connect with a professional who specializes in both mood disorders and substance use. A psychiatrist can help you safely evaluate how substance use interacts with your bipolar medication and mood cycles, while a therapist trained in dual diagnosis can provide strategies to address both issues. Withdrawal from substances can also impact mood, so having medical guidance is vital for your safety.\n\nWhile seeking professional help is the priority, there are small steps you can take today. You might start by simply writing down the specific moments when you feel the urge to use, noting what emotion or situation triggered it. This isn't about stopping immediately, but about building awareness. Also, consider reaching out to one supportive person in your life and sharing what you've shared here—even just saying, \"I'm struggling and I'm looking for help,\" can relieve some of the burden.\n\nYou have already taken a brave first step by naming the problem.

They can provide a safe and non-judgmental space to discuss your struggles and develop a treatment plan to help you overcome your addiction. They can also provide support and guidance to help you stay sober.\n\n2.  **Support groups:** Join a support group or online community where you can connect with others who are going through similar experiences. Sharing your experiences and hearing the stories of others can be incredibly powerful in helping you feel less alone in your struggles.\n\n3.  **Self-care:** Taking care of your physical health is also crucial in helping you recover. Make sure to eat well, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep. These can help you feel more grounded and centered, making it easier to stay sober.\n\n4.  **Medication:** If you're struggling with addiction, your doctor or a therapist may prescribe medication to help you manage your symptoms.

It takes a lot of courage to explore these feelings, and I want you to know that the confusion and curiosity you're experiencing are completely normal. Many people find that their understanding of their own sexuality evolves over time, and it's okay not to have a definitive label right now. Your feelings are valid, and there is no rush to define them.\n\nWhat you're describing—attraction to more than one gender—could certainly align with bisexuality, but it's also perfectly fine to sit with the question and explore what these attractions mean to you personally. Sometimes, placing pressure on ourselves to find the \"right\" label can create more anxiety. Instead, I might encourage you to focus on the feelings themselves. In a safe and reflective way, you could consider what these attractions feel like, what thoughts or emotions come up, and what you might want to explore further.\n\nAs a counselor, my role is to support you in this process of self-discovery without judgment. I would recommend creating a private space, like a journal, to honestly document your thoughts and feelings. If these feelings become distressing or you'd like to explore them in more depth, seeking ongoing support from a therapist who specializes in LGBTQ+ affirmative care could be very beneficial.

While I can offer some general strategies, it's important to note that for a formal assessment and treatment plan, working one-on-one with a therapist specializing in behavioral addictions would be the most effective path. They can help you explore the underlying needs this scrolling meets—perhaps it's a way to manage stress, anxiety, or loneliness—and develop a personalized approach.\n\nOn a practical level, we can look at ways to introduce more intentionality.

From there, consider implementing \"environmental design.\" This means making the habit harder to start. You could charge your phone outside the bedroom, delete the most absorbing apps for a trial period, or use app timers with a password set by a friend. More importantly, schedule a specific, rewarding activity for the time you usually scroll—like reading a physical book, a short walk, or a hobby.

Set a timer to remind you when it's time to stop.\n\n2.  **Identify your why:** Reflect on why you're using your phone. Are you using it for entertainment, information, or social media?

I wonder if maybe the first step is for you to start seeing this decision as yours, rather than yours together. The way your husband treats you is not your fault, Texas. Your lies are a natural and normal way of you avoiding situations and encounters that feel unsafe for you. The problem is not your lying. The problem is that you don't feel safe enough to be honest with a person you're supposed to be able to trust.There's an analogy that I sometimes use; I don't know if this is scientifically true or simply a useful story, but it's powerful either way, so I will tell it to you.If you take a frog and drop it into a pot of boiling water, the frog will jump out immediately, knowing instinctively that if it stays in the pot, it will die. If you take a frog, however, and put it in a pot of cold water, and slowly, slowly, heat it to boiling, the frog will boil to death because it will fail to recognise the moment when it no longer has the energy to jump out of the pot; by the time it realises it's dying, it has lost its strength.

What you're describing—feeling disconnected from your own life and your true self—is a deeply significant experience, and it takes courage to acknowledge it. Many people go through periods where they feel they are living on autopilot or according to others' expectations, and the resulting sense of disconnection can be both unsettling and spiritually draining. Your feelings are completely valid.\n\nThis struggle to connect with your authentic self is often a signal from within, an invitation to explore and rediscover who you are beneath the roles and routines. As a starting point, I encourage you to gently create some space for self-reflection. This might look like setting aside quiet time for journaling, meditation, or simply spending time in nature. Ask yourself compassionate questions: \"When have I felt most alive or at peace?\" \"What values feel intrinsically mine, not borrowed from others?\" \"What small choice could I make today that feels more authentic?\" There is no need for immediate, grand answers; the goal is to begin a kind and curious dialogue with yourself.\n\nIt's important to note that while these feelings are a common part of the human and spiritual journey, they can sometimes be linked to underlying conditions like depression or anxiety. If this sense of disconnection is accompanied by persistent low mood, hopelessness, or it's significantly impacting your daily functioning, I strongly recommend connecting with a mental health professional. A therapist can provide a supportive space to navigate this exploration safely and deeply.\n\nYou have already taken the vital first step by recognizing this disconnect.

These early messages become your template for how you have learned to see yourself and what you expect from others.

It takes a great deal of courage to articulate feelings about gender that feel fluid and hard to pin down. What you're describing—the disconnect between an assigned label and your internal sense of self, and the panic that arises when asked to define it—is a deeply valid and challenging experience. Many people navigating gender identity feel this same pressure to have a \"perfect\" answer ready for the world, and it's completely understandable to default to a familiar label even when it doesn't fit.\n\nFirst, I want to affirm that your gender identity is yours to explore and define, on your own timeline.

The discomfort and panic you feel when questioned is often a signal that the label being used doesn't honor your full, authentic self.\n\nAs a counselor, my role is to support you in this exploration in a safe, non-judgmental space.

What can I do to try and control it?", "chosen": "I'm going to reframe this and you can decide if this is helpful!What I'm reading based on what you gave is that you are actually doing your best to manage intense feelings of internal dysregulation. Anger is something that is generally a protective emotion that quickly arises to keep us safe in some way, whether or not the situation is truly a threat. The part of our brain that perceives this is not controllable to us, so we don't get to decide what emotion(s) we respond with.It does also sound like you are experiencing some significant anxiety, maybe even underlying the anger? Without knowing the context, it's hard to say what would help on an individual level but working through those triggers and what is really influencing them deep down could be beneficial. There's many different ways to do that in therapy if you so choose that as your path.If you do decide to see a therapist, most will tell you that the goal is not necessarily to control your anxiety or anger. Sometimes there's a strong set of beliefs that, when activated, are catalysts to strong emotions that influence behavior. Trying to control an emotion on its own is usually unsuccessful for people because it leaves out all the other powerful elements at play. Emotions are information and the brain sends that information out because it believes we need it at that time. Therapists can help unravel that with you in whatever way you need, whether that's with somatic work, work at the level of belief (or schemas), or otherwise---hitting it at these deeper layers can unpair and/or decrease emotional responses. It all takes work and time, so don't get down on yourself if the process is complicated or slower than you expected or hoped for.What we know though is that the brain is very capable of change (even if it's painful).

With acquaintances, you might have a slightly more prepared, concise answer like, \"I'm non-binary, which means my gender isn't strictly male or female.\" For closer friends or in supportive settings, you can share more.

Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I can't get it out. How can I stop these thoughts?", "chosen": "Scary thoughts can feel overwhelming at times as well as feeling quite real. I want to acknowledge how scary they can feel, but there is hope and new skills you can learn to work with these types of thoughts. The first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them. I also realize that might seem really hard to do, but here's a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work. Thoughts arise in the mind all the time, our brain is a thought machine. Many thoughts drift by like clouds and we don't pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way, i.e., scary, angry, happy, sad, and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particulate thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety. So, how do we work or stop those scary thought streams? One new skill to implement comes from the work of Rick Hansen, he wrote the book Buddha's Brain,\" he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts. Hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way, the brain is like Velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts. There are reasons that our brain works this way, but I don't have time to go into all of that in this response. So, it's just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking, actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories, this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time.

That is a wise and important boundary. Your safety is the priority.\n\nThe lack of sleep you're experiencing is both a symptom of your stress and a factor that makes coping even harder. We can work on some practical steps for sleep. Try to create a small, calming bedtime ritual, even if it's just 10 minutes of reading or deep breathing in your room. Consistency is key, so aim to go to bed and wake up at similar times, even on days you feel drained.

This is good news, because you don't necessarily have to be at the end of the process to end an unhealthy relationship. We just have to accept that there will be feelings that come up even after the relationship is over.

They may even regret ending the relationship for a little while.

{"id": "counsel_00908_aug_1", "prompt": "After struggling with an eating disorder for several years, I'm now a new mom in my early 30s. The stress and lack of sleep have made my binge-purge cycles worse, and I'm terrified this will affect my ability to care for my child. I desperately need to find a way to break this pattern for good. Can anyone recommend a starting point?", "chosen": "Thank you so much for reaching out and for your incredible courage in sharing this. First, I want to acknowledge the profound strength it takes to be navigating new motherhood while also confronting a resurgence of your eating disorder. Your feelings of fear and desperation are completely understandable, and your desire to break this pattern for your child's sake—and for your own—is a powerful motivator for change.\n\nIt is very common for major life transitions, like becoming a parent, with its associated stress and sleep deprivation, to exacerbate previous struggles. Please know that this does not reflect a failure on your part, but rather signals that your coping system is under immense strain and needs renewed, professional support. The most critical starting point I can recommend is to reconnect with a professional treatment team. Given that you are postpartum, this is especially important for both your and your baby's wellbeing. A team specializing in eating disorders—including a therapist, a registered dietitian, and a physician—can create a plan that addresses the unique physical and emotional demands of this stage. They can help you develop strategies to manage stress and sleep disruption in healthier ways, directly interrupting the binge-purge cycle.\n\nOn a practical level, while you seek professional support, you can begin by practicing small acts of self-compassion. When you feel the urge to binge, if possible, pause for even 60 seconds. In that moment, ask yourself: \"What do I truly need right now?\" It might be rest, a glass of water, a few deep breaths, or to reach out to a trusted friend. Nourishing your body regularly with scheduled meals and snacks can also help stabilize blood sugar and reduce the physiological drive to binge. Remember, recovery is not about perfection, but about persistence. You have already taken a brave first step by asking for help.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:\n\n**Seek Professional Help**\n\n1.  **Find a Therapist**: Look for a therapist who specializes in eating disorders, especially one who has experience working with mothers. You can ask your primary care physician or OB-GYN for a referral. You can also check with your insurance provider for in-network therapists.\n2.  **Get Support Groups**: Join a support group, either in-person or online, to connect with others who understand what you're going through.

I'm worn out, I've worked on all of my family relationships, I'm doing great in school, I'm kind to those in need and otherwise. I stick to my religious beliefs and leave room for mistakes and learn from others so I don't have to make as many and the ones I do I learn from. Somehow it's still not good enough and nothing I do works. Nothing has changed, and I feel hopeless. Any suggestions or ideas?", "chosen": "Hello, and let me say first, what a great question! There are so many people putting forth their 100% everyday and often times, do not get the credit they deserve. Without being able to fully understand where you're question is coming from, I think there are a couple of different ways to look at this question.First, I think it's important for us to consider the message being sent by those in your life stating that you're \"not good enough.\" Is that ACTUALLY what they said, or is this just what you heard? Sometimes, because of our own self-doubts and fears, we skew and misinterpret the messages we receive from others. Again, listen to the message being sent and attempt to remain objective. Is the message being sent coming from a place of love or concern? If so, have an honest and open communication with that individual about what your concerns are regarding the amount of energy and time you're spending on being \"good enough.\" Explore with them how you feel you'r already giving your best.If the person is unwilling to work at understanding this concern you have, then it may be time to explore the relationship. Some relationships we engage in can be toxic, especially if the other person is toxic. It may be they have their own \"stuff\" going on and they feel the need to constantly put others down to make themselves feel better. If you're in the direct path of this individual, then it serves to reason you will probably be in the direct fire, as well. Explore whether or not you want this relationship to continue in your life. If it's a relationship that MUST continue, then work on what you will do to distance yourself from their toxicity or their problems. Until they're willing to work on these issues for themselves, then it may be necessary to find an exit strategy, such as leaving the room or simply refusing to engage in the conversation. Another perspective of this question is exploring the reason why it's important for YOU to satisfy the expectations of these other individuals? NO ONE will ever be 100% \"good enough\" for EVERYONE. Every single person has their own set of expectations in themselves and expectations in others. It would be impossible to satisfy all of those expectations for every single person in our lives. The question becomes, what is it WITHIN you that feels the need to meet these expectations? There is most likely a part of you, yourself, as an individual that feels \"less than\" and feels as if you, yourself, are not good enough. It then becomes impossible to every feel \"good enough\" for others, because it's really YOU you're trying to feel good enough for. If you already feel as if you're doing everything you can do to be at your best version of yourself, then really work on LETTING GO of the rest. No one is perfect, and striving for perfection in our lives only creates more anxiety and stress. Find a middle ground in which you are happy with your accomplishments and your daily goals, and learn to let go of what's left. After all, tomorrow is a new day and you can work on more of your goals tomorrow!I recommend doing this by finding a mantra, a statement or phrase you can repeat to yourself anytime you start to feel that sense of stress and pressure from striving for perfection. The mantra can remind you to let go of this expectation you have for yourself or that others have for you so you can also let go of the stress and anxiety surrounding the expectation. I leave you with one of my favorite quotes that perhaps you can use as your mantra, \"No one can make you feel inferior without your consent. \" - Eleanor Roosevelt.", "rejected": "I can see that you're feeling overwhelmed and feeling hopeless, and it's understandable.

You're kind to those in need, you're doing well in school, and you're sticking to your values and beliefs. That's something to be proud of.\n\nAs for the feeling of hopelessness, I want to suggest a few things that might help. Have you tried talking to someone you trust about how you're feeling? Sometimes just talking to someone who cares can make a big difference. Maybe you could try reaching out to a trusted teacher, a family member, or a close friend. Sometimes, talking to someone who understands can help you gain a different perspective on things.\n\nAlso, it might be helpful to break things down into smaller, more manageable tasks.

I'm feeling so overwhelmed. What can I do?", "chosen": "My very first thought is this is so much to carry on your own! A mother's instinct is to care for her children so I can imagine how hard it must be to see your son in pain and struggling. I hear a ping of helplessness in there as well. That's heavy.My question is: who is supporting you? I know nothing about the context, but I wonder if the role you hold often is that of caretaker. It may not be that the end-all-be-all answer is to be cared for, but the absence of care (or even self-care) can seem like we are only existing for others. Sometimes having someone to rely on can help take off some of the edge--the pressure--of all that is overwhelming.Despite that, it may be that the situation continues to be exactly what it is, providing a steady stream of stress for you (which would be so difficult). I don't think anyone can tell you what to do because no one here has to live with those consequences, good or bad. Just a note that sometimes with men it is harder to reach out for help. Perhaps he feels comfortable enough for you to know he's struggling (which means you have provided him a safe space to do just that) but not comfortable enough to interact with a stranger about those same struggles. Men often avoid therapy because it's seen as weak and/or means you need help. Planting seeds here is sometimes all you can do, as hard as that is.As far as supporting goes, there's much more you can do there if he is ready to receive that. If you are seeing him in the midst of panic, the best thing you can do is let him know you are there for him. Maybe that means being there physically, or continuing to give him encouragement along the way (e.g., \"You got this\", \"I know this is hard\", etc.). If you aren't present for the attacks but he's telling you about them, you can ask what you can provide for him in those moments or how you can help him afterward. Panic attacks can be taxing on the body so sometimes people need time to recover. Remember that you also need to recover here, too. It's very painful to watch someone you love panic.

I am in my early 30s, and I feel like I am trapped in my body, mind, soul, and house because I feel embarrassed to go anywhere or talk to anyone.", "chosen": "There's SO much help for repetitive thoughts in the counseling world! The one thing I'd for sure ask if we met in person is what those repetitive thought patterns look like. Some repetitive thoughts are more like obsessive thoughts. For example, that may mean that every time you leave a room, your obsessive thought is to switch the light on and off 5 times. Or every time you touch a door handle, you think about the germs you came into contact with and washing your hands multiple times. Sometimes it's more about the same thoughts repeating about bad things that may happen, or critical thoughts we have about ourselves. Your statement about \"feeling confident again\" gives me the sense that maybe you struggle with the ways in which you think about yourself.Assuming it's obsessive thoughts: exposure and response prevention therapy is an excellent form of treatment. Typically, obsessive thoughts influence compulsions, which usually show up as very strict, repetitive rituals in order to manage anxiety. Exposure and response prevention exposes you to the things that increase anxiety, while response prevention helps you to sit through that anxiety response without performing a compulsion. For example, you touch a door handle. Your anxiety increases. You obsess about the germs you came into contact with and have a strong urge to wash your hands multiple times. Instead, you sit through the anxiety, let the anxiety decrease on its own, and slowly unpair that anxious response with the behavior. The more you do this, the more it breaks up those thinking/behavior patterns that make you feel chained to them.Assuming it's self-critical thoughts: cognitive-behavioral therapy can work well here. Everyone's brain has a default track, that when met with struggle, plays over and over like a broken record. The more you give into that, the more it plays. The trick here is creating a competing track, or turning the volume up on a track that boosts your confidence instead of shooting it down. Some ways to do that are really identifying and writing down what those repetitive thoughts are. You probably already know them pretty well if they repeat often. Then next to them--write out a line that has an heir of confidence and/or gentleness. For example, if your repetitive thought is that you are a failure, you may write out a sentence that is something like: I may be struggling greatly with this situation, yet I am still trying super hard to get better and that's definitely not a failure. Every separate repetitive thought can have its own competing sentence. Initially, these new thoughts will feel weird, foreign, and maybe even like they don't do anything. Give it time. The repetitive thoughts have had years to grow, so these new thoughts need time, too. They are, literally, new pathways in the brain and the more they are traveled, the stronger they will get.I'm also sensing that there's a combination of anxiety and depression. I would assume that you are probably feeling pretty cut off from the world if you don't want to talk to anyone. That can be so lonely and isolating. Because connection is basically crucial for healing, it may be very beneficial for you to see a counselor or find a support that feels safe to you. Counselors are usually trained very well in these types of issues and some offer telehealth if you are having trouble leaving your home. It might feel scary and strange at first, but you are in a lot of pain and deserve healing.Hope this helps a bit. Go with your gut and do what you feel is right for you!

It is deeply unfair to feel that a cornerstone of your own recovery—the very community that helped you build a sober life—is now being restricted. That community isn't just a meeting; it's a source of strength, identity, and ongoing maintenance. It's completely understandable to feel hurt, angry, and even worried about how this impacts your personal wellness.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the policy is likely rooted in the principle of protecting both you and potential clients.

While the policy feels rigid, its intent is to prevent any compromise to your professional integrity or anyone else's sense of safety and anonymity.\n\nPractically, we need to strategize to protect your recovery. First, I encourage you to have a clarifying conversation with your supervisor. Ask if the restriction is absolute, or if exceptions exist for meetings in neighboring towns where your professional role is unknown. Exploring alternative recovery communities is crucial—perhaps online meetings, different fellowship types (like SMART Recovery), or meetings in a nearby city could become your new \"home group.\" This is also a moment to strengthen other recovery tools: your personal network, therapy, mindfulness practices, and perhaps connecting with other professionals in recovery for support.\n\nYour recovery is paramount.

The time right after people leave the hospital after receiving psychiatric services is a time of high risk for suicide. It is very important, after hospitalization, to get follow-up care with a professional as soon as possible. If your husband has an established therapist, this is the time to call. It is also a good time to alert your support system of friends, family, clergy or others to let them know he is still struggling. This is good support for him AND you.It is important to think about means and opportunity to make another attempt. Means really do matter. So, if you have a firearm in the home, it is really important to remove it. You can't remove all things that a person may hurt themselves with, but some things are more lethal than others. Firearms are very lethal. I am not sure what means he used last time, but try to reduce the opportunity for him to access it again. This is where your support system can help out. People can take turns hanging out with him until you are sure the crisis is over.If you believe that an attempt is going to occur, talk to your husband about going back to the hospital. If he refuses, you will want to find out what your options are to have him go even if he doesn't want to. I know the thought of that really hurts, but it can save his life. Calling 9-1-1 is always a good option if you are not sure. Usually a suicide crisis, meaning they want to harm themselves right now, lasts a few minutes, hours or days. Sometimes when you get them through the crisis stage, they no longer want to commit suicide. But, as you are indicating, that feeling of wanting to commit suicide can come back again.

Watching someone you love struggle with addiction, especially your own child, is profoundly painful and can leave you feeling helpless. Your desire to get him help comes from a place of love, and that is completely understandable.\n\nRegarding your specific question about emergency interventions, the laws governing involuntary commitment for substance use, often called civil commitment or involuntary assessment, vary significantly by state. In most states, the criteria are very strict and typically require the person to be an immediate, demonstrable danger to themselves or others due to their substance use, or to be gravely disabled and unable to care for themselves. This is a legal process that usually involves petitioning the court, and the standards are high. I strongly encourage you to consult with a local addiction specialist attorney or contact your state's Department of Health or Behavioral Health services. They can provide you with precise information about the statutes and procedures in your jurisdiction.\n\nWhile you explore those options, I also recommend connecting with support for yourself. Organizations like Al-Anon or SMART Recovery Family & Friends are designed for people exactly in your situation. They can offer you coping strategies, emotional support, and sometimes practical advice on communication techniques that may eventually help your son choose treatment.

This is often done for a family member or a guardian who is concerned about the individual's well-being.\n*   **Involuntary commitment for substance abuse treatment**: Some states have laws that allow for involuntary commitment to substance abuse treatment for a set period (usually up to 90 days).

How do I accept the situation and get over my romantic feelings without losing his friendship?", "chosen": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes courage to articulate such a complex and emotionally charged situation. What you're describing is incredibly challenging—navigating deep feelings for a friend and colleague, especially after a shift in the physical nature of your relationship, is a painful and confusing experience. Your desire to both preserve a meaningful friendship and find peace for yourself is completely understandable, and your feelings of hope and confusion are valid given the mixed signals you've described.\n\nThe core difficulty here lies in the conflict between your emotional reality and the agreed-upon \"professional\" boundary. To move forward, you will likely need to create more space and clarity than currently exists. While daily chats and lunches maintain a close connection, they may also be inadvertently feeding the romantic feelings you're trying to release. I would gently suggest considering a temporary, intentional pullback in contact. This isn't about punishment or ending the friendship, but about creating the emotional distance necessary for your feelings to settle. You might reduce the daily chats to a few times a week and opt for group lunches instead of one-on-one for a period.\n\nIt is also crucial to examine his behavior through the lens of his stated commitment to being \"professional\" and his current relationship. A naturally warm demeanor can feel personal, but it may not signify a change in his intentions. Protecting your heart means accepting his actions at face value: he is a friend and colleague who is dating someone else. Redirecting the energy you spend analyzing his looks and compliments into nurturing other friendships, hobbies, or personal goals can be a powerful step toward acceptance.\n\nFinally, please know that struggling to let go under these circumstances is very common.

For example, depression is diagnosed differently if there's a bipolar element or if someone is withdrawing from drugs or alcohol. It doesn't sound like that's what you're experiencing, but those are just two examples of many. How that's diagnosed is a process that a therapist is best equipped to do in person with a thorough assessment. Sometimes we find that depression is subclinical, meaning it doesn't reach the typical level of \"disorder\" (that doesn't mean it's less important or worthy of care). Most of the time, diagnosis doesn't make a huge difference in treatment, but there are some disorders that need pretty specific modalities and components--for example, people with Bipolar I often need medication to help stabilize symptoms.I'd also say that, more importantly, you know yourself best. You are clearly trying to make sense of some things you are feeling and maybe how they are connected to some things you've been through. I can also see you are motivated to feel better!

That is a crucial step in your care. Regarding the specific pharmaceutical concern you raised, I want to be transparent about my professional boundaries. While I can offer support around the emotional and psychological impact of medication, any detailed questions about dosage, side effects, or pharmaceutical specifics must be directed to your prescribing physician or psychiatrist. They have the medical training to address those concerns fully and safely. I encourage you to share these same worries with them, and we can even role-play how to start that conversation if it would feel helpful.\n\nFor now, let's focus on some grounding strategies to help manage the agitation you're feeling. When these concerns arise, try the \"5-4-3-2-1\" sensory exercise: notice five things you see, four you can touch, three you hear, two you smell, and one you taste. This can help anchor you in the present moment. Also, please know that if these feelings ever escalate to where you have thoughts of harming yourself or others, it is critical to reach out to your psychiatrist immediately, contact a crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency room.\n\nI am here to support you through the emotional journey of your treatment. In our next session, we can process this experience further and explore how to build a collaborative support system between you, your therapist, and your medical providers.

You don't tell us whether you live together or not. If you do, your position is perhaps more difficult, because his daughter's behaviours affect you; you live in the home. A bottom line for me is you don't tell someone else how to parent. That's for your boyfriend to decide. When he's there, he's the parent, and he makes the decisions about how she is disciplined (or not). Even if you have good ideas or you completely disagree, or you think you see something that he's not seeing, it's simply not for you to interfere there. It sounds like your boyfriend is struggling emotionally and needs support. He has had a lot of losses in his life and maybe every time his daughter leaves he feels powerless and abandoned. Do you talk about these things? Can you find that line of supporting him but not telling him what to do?Although I suggest you leave the parenting to him, what you can do is tell him what you see, offer suggestions if he's open to it, and talk about the ways in which the situation affects you. It makes sense to say \"I see you struggling and I don't know how to help\", \"I've noticed that you seem afraid to discipline her. Are you aware that it's coming across this way? Do you need help?\", or \"I feel sad and frustrated when we don't spend any time alone together.\" You sound a bit resentful of his daughter.

It's natural to feel that she's not meeting his expectations, especially when he's used to having her around all the time.\n\nThat being said, his response of saying \"Well, I don't know what to tell you\" may not be the most helpful response to her behavior. It might be better to address the issue directly, expressing how her behavior is affecting him and his feelings. \n\nIt might be worth exploring some open and honest communication with his girlfriend about what he needs from her. It's possible that she's not even aware of the impact her behavior is having on him. He could try to explain to her that her behavior is making him feel like he's walking on eggshells around her, and that he wants a more respectful and open relationship.\n\nIt's also worth noting that her being young might not be a valid reason to blame for her behavior.

First, I must mention that most insurances now cover for many different types of issues, including family issues. If your girlfriend lives with you, most insurances now cover \"live-in partners,\" as well. If you have insurance, contact your policy provider and ask whether or not couples counseling is included.Aside from insurance, the next place that comes to mind is a religious affiliation. Do you belong to a church or other religious organization? Many of the pastors or leaders in these disciplines have significant training in counseling, as well as assisting with marriage and couples counseling. These services are ordinarily offered free of charge to members.Another option might be to explore support groups within the area. There may be a group in the form of a couples support group that brings couples together to explore their relationships in the safety of the group.

What are some effective ways to manage this pressure?", "chosen": "Thank you for reaching out and sharing what you're experiencing. It takes courage to acknowledge feeling overwhelmed, and I want to start by validating that what you're feeling is completely understandable. When our plates get too full, it's common to feel the weight of that pressure, and it can impact us mentally, emotionally, and physically. You are not alone in this.\n\nAs a first step, I often encourage clients to practice a brief \"pressure audit.\" When you have a quiet moment, write down everything that feels like it's on your plate. Then, look at each item and ask yourself: What is a true deadline? What can be delegated or postponed? What can be broken down into a smaller, less daunting step? This can help move the feeling from a general sense of overwhelm to a more manageable list of specific tasks.\n\nIn terms of immediate coping, grounding techniques can be very effective when the feeling becomes intense. Try the 5-4-3-2-1 method: name five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one you can taste. This brings your nervous system back to the present. Also, please remember the importance of foundational self-care—even when time is tight. Prioritizing sleep, hydration, and short breaks for deep breathing can significantly impact your resilience.\n\nIf these feelings persist, intensify, or begin to affect your ability to function in your daily roles, I strongly encourage you to consider speaking with a counselor or therapist in your area. They can provide personalized support and strategies tailored to your specific situation. My role here is to offer general guidance, but ongoing, one-on-one support is invaluable for navigating chronic stress.\n\nPlease be gentle with yourself.

It shows a real depth of consideration for the therapeutic process, whether you're exploring this from the perspective of a future therapist or a current client. Acknowledging these challenges is a crucial step in navigating them effectively.\n\nYou're right to recognize that this work, while deeply rewarding, comes with its own set of complexities. Therapists often face challenges like managing their own emotional reactions (countertransference) to a client's story, navigating moments of therapeutic impasse where progress feels stalled, and maintaining professional boundaries while building a genuine, trusting connection. There's also the weight of ethical decision-making and the risk of compassion fatigue or burnout from consistently holding space for others' pain.\n\nIt's essential for therapists to have their own support systems and professional safeguards in place to meet these challenges. This includes regular clinical supervision, ongoing personal therapy, and a commitment to self-care. These aren't signs of weakness but are fundamental to ethical and sustainable practice. They ensure the therapist can remain fully present, objective, and emotionally available for their clients.\n\nIf you are a therapist or trainee grappling with these feelings, I gently encourage you to bring these very questions to your supervisor. If you are a client concerned about your therapist's ability to hold your story, know that your therapist's professional responsibility is to manage their own process so they can be fully there for you.

It's understandable that you're distressed, both by the fallout for your friend and the strain in your relationship with her.\n\nWhat you're describing is a complex interpersonal situation with real consequences. Your roommate's anger is a natural reaction to her professional environment becoming awkward and potentially compromised, and your guilt is a signal that this crossed a personal value for you. A crucial first step is to offer a sincere and full apology to your roommate, without excuses. Acknowledge that you pushed her into something she was hesitant about, that you now see it was unwise, and that you regret the position it put her in at work. The goal isn't to immediately fix your friendship, but to take full responsibility.\n\nIt's also important to consider how to make amends. Ask your roommate, without pressure, if there's anything you can do to support her as she navigates the awkwardness at work. Beyond that, I encourage you to reflect on what led to pushing the joke initially. Was it boredom, a desire for connection, or something else? Understanding that impulse can be a powerful learning moment to prevent similar situations.\n\nIf these ruminations become overwhelming or start to significantly impact your mood or daily functioning, I would gently suggest speaking with a counselor for a few sessions.

Many couples navigate differences in sexual interests, and it's a sign of a healthy relationship that you're seeking to understand this more deeply.\n\nThe distinction between a \"common variation\" and a \"fetish\" can feel confusing, as these terms are often used loosely. In a clinical sense, a fetish typically refers to a specific object or non-genital body part that is intensely focused on for sexual arousal and is often necessary for sexual satisfaction. What many people call a fetish is more accurately a strong preference or a kink—a less common but still healthy variation of sexual expression. The most important questions are: Does this interest cause you distress or dysfunction? Is it consensual and safe? If the answers are no and yes, respectively, it often falls within the broad spectrum of human sexuality.\n\nA key step is open, compassionate communication with your partner. Approach the conversation from a place of sharing your own feelings (\"I feel...\") rather than making demands. The goal is mutual understanding, not immediate agreement. Exploring resources together, like books or websites from reputable sex therapists, can also help normalize the discussion.\n\nIf this difference is causing significant distress, conflict, or feelings of shame, seeking guidance from a certified sex therapist can be incredibly beneficial.

You might try writing down not just the wonderful memories, but also the challenges you faced in college—the exams, the heartbreaks, the insecurities. This creates a more balanced picture.

Feeling conflicted during family celebrations is completely understandable; you're navigating the delicate space between your own spiritual identity and the desire to connect with your partner's family. It's normal to feel a sense of dissonance or even loneliness in these moments.\n\nAs a counselor, I want to emphasize that your personal beliefs are valid and deserve respect. A helpful first step might be to have an open and gentle conversation with your partner about these feelings when you're both in a calm, private setting. Discuss what these traditions mean to their family, how you each envision navigating these differences long-term, and what support you might need from each other. This isn't about changing anyone's beliefs, but about finding mutual understanding and creating a plan that honors both of your backgrounds.\n\nIn the moment, you might consider practical strategies like participating in a respectful, observational way that doesn't compromise your own values—perhaps by focusing on the universal themes of gratitude, family, or peace that many traditions share. It can also be powerful to privately set a simple intention for yourself before the gathering, such as \"I am here to show love to my partner and their family,\" which can serve as an anchor if you feel unsettled.\n\nIf these feelings are causing significant distress or tension in your relationship, seeking support from a couples counselor or a therapist specializing in intercultural or interfaith dynamics could be very beneficial.

The most constructive path forward involves accountability and repair.\n\nA crucial step is to give your sibling the space they need right now. Their silence likely reflects their own hurt and confusion, not a permanent rejection of you. When the time feels right, I encourage you to write a sincere, non-defensive apology.

It takes a great deal of courage to articulate such a complex and painful experience, especially when it involves someone widely respected.

Your feelings of confusion and unsettlement are completely understandable given the power dynamics and social repercussions you've faced.\n\nFirst, I want to validate that your perception is worthy of trust. Gaslighting, by its very nature, is designed to make you doubt your own reality. The fact that you noticed a stark contrast between his private behavior and public persona is a significant observation. Often in these situations, our physiological and emotional responses—feelings of anxiety, dread, or a knot in your stomach before interactions—are important data points that confirm something is amiss, even when the logical evidence feels obscured.\n\nA helpful step can be to engage in a process of reality-testing outside of that environment. Could you confidentially speak with a therapist? An objective professional can provide a safe space to untangle your experiences without any conflict of interest. Additionally, you might begin privately journaling specific incidents, noting dates, what was said, and how it made you feel. This can help solidify your narrative against the fog of gaslighting.\n\nYour safety and well-being are paramount. While navigating this professional landscape, it may be necessary to set firm, internal boundaries regarding your expectations of this individual and the colleagues who dismissed you.

I'm always the last one to fall asleep and the first to wake. I hate falling asleep. The longest I've went without sleep is three days.", "chosen": "No wonder you are scared to sleep if this is what you are going through.My first thought is that it's possible your dreams are your brain's way of trying to process something that scares you or has scared you. There's not a lot of research on the purpose of dreams, but one theory is that stuff you don't want to deal with consciously is able to come through via your unconscious brain as a dream (or nightmare). Another theory is more of Gestalt nature, where all your dream figures represent a part of you--for example, the part of you being attacked would be the side of you that feels weak, whereas the attacker is the side of you that you feel is bad or evil. Either way, your reactions are definitely legit because nightmares tend to flood the brain in a pretty emotionally raw form.I am also curious if you had trouble sleeping before you started having these dreams. Is it because of these nightmares that sleep is an issue, or have the sleep issues been a part of your life longer than the dreams? It may not mean a whole lot no matter what order they came in, but it would be interesting to know if the catalyst was actually the dreams to begin with. The big question here is if not having these nightmares would improve your sleep and lessen your anxiety about sleeping, overall.As for the anxiety attacks, there's a lot here you can try. Your brain is seeing sleep, nightmares, or both as a threat. The way to signal safety to your brain is to practice some relaxation techniques--mindful breathing can be helpful or if you find it hard to sit still, you can do some walking mindfulness. Maybe you've heard of the Calm app--it's so great for sleep issues. They have sleep stories and soundscapes, as well as guided breathing exercises. This is speaking more to the thinking process, but remind yourself that the dreams aren't real and they can't hurt you. That doesn't mean you won't have anxiety and you have to fully believe it, it just means that you don't have to get caught up in the fear response. You also mention that they \"try\" to hurt you. Have you ever done things to fight them off? Or do you run? It's OK if your response is to freeze--I'm just curious how you view yourself in that dream. If you are feeling powerless (which would be normal) it may be worth your time to imagine how you want to fight them off. What weapons would you choose? What would escape look like? Imagining you in charge may help change your experience of the dreams.Also remember that even though panic attacks feel awful, they won't hurt you. It's a really terrifying feeling to be trapped in your body during an attack, but the response is meant to get us out of danger even though there is no real threat. If you do a google search for panic attack help sites, there's so many that detail more of this response and how to move through an attack. Of course, seeing a counselor might be beneficial if you are sensing that there's something bigger underlying the dreams.

It takes courage to articulate such a complex and emotionally charged situation. What you're describing—developing feelings for a close friend at work, navigating a shift after an intimate encounter, and feeling conflicted about creating distance—is understandably painful and challenging. It's completely normal to feel a mix of sadness, confusion, and even grief for the friendship as it was.\n\nFirst, I want to validate your instinct to create some space. After a significant emotional event, giving yourself room to process is often a healthy form of self-protection. It allows your feelings to settle so you can discern what you truly need moving forward. The workplace dynamic adds a significant layer of complexity, as you must balance your emotional well-being with professional courtesy and teamwork.\n\nA helpful first step could be to engage in some gentle self-reflection. When you feel ready, ask yourself: What is my primary goal? Is it to preserve the friendship, to move on completely, or to find a new, sustainable way to interact at work? There is no right answer, only what serves your long-term peace.\n\nGiven that this involves a workplace relationship, I must emphasize the importance of maintaining professional boundaries for your own protection and career stability. This can be incredibly difficult to navigate alone. If these feelings of conflict persist or begin to impact your work or overall well-being, I strongly encourage you to consider speaking with a counselor for ongoing, personalized support.

You might consider talking to your friend about how you're feeling. This can be a way to gauge their feelings about you, and it might help you clear the air.\n3.  You might want to take some time for self-reflection. Ask yourself what you want from this friendship, and what you're willing to accept. This can help you figure out what you're looking for in a potential romantic relationship.\n4.  It's also worth considering the other person's feelings and boundaries.

It creates a lot of internal tension and leaves me feeling hollow and inadequate. I socialize with plenty of people, but my mind keeps drifting to sexual scenarios, which distracts me from my studies and makes me question if I'm normal.", "chosen": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes courage to articulate these feelings, and I want you to know that what you're experiencing is a very common and human struggle. The internal tension, the feelings of hollowness and inadequacy—these are significant emotional experiences, and it's completely understandable that they are causing you distress. Many people, especially in their early twenties, grapple with the intersection of natural sexual feelings, societal expectations, and personal identity.\n\nFirst, let me offer a gentle reassurance: having sexual fantasies, including about people you know, is a normal part of human sexuality. Our brains are wired for connection and attraction. However, when these thoughts become intrusive, distracting, and lead to persistent negative feelings about yourself, it's a sign that they are impacting your well-being. This is the important piece to address—not the fantasies themselves, but the distress and self-judgment they are triggering.\n\nThe combination of distraction from your studies and questioning your normalcy tells me this is more than just a passing phase. A helpful next step would be to explore these patterns with more support. Consider speaking with a therapist, preferably one who specializes in sexuality or young adult issues. They can provide a confidential space to unpack these feelings without judgment, help you understand the root of the \"hollow\" sensation, and develop strategies to manage intrusive thoughts. Cognitive-behavioral techniques, for instance, can be very effective in gently redirecting focus and reducing the power these thoughts have over your day.\n\nIn the short term, practice self-compassion. When you notice the thoughts arising, acknowledge them without judgment—\"There's that thought again\"—and then consciously guide your attention back to the present task or interaction. Mindfulness exercises can strengthen this skill. Remember, your worth is not defined by your sexual experience. You are navigating a complex aspect of life, and seeking to understand it better is a sign of strength, not inadequacy.

It takes a lot of courage and self-awareness to look at your cannabis use in this way and to connect it to the impact it's having on your relationship and your own well-being. The feelings of shame, regret, and confusion you're describing are very real and valid. It's clear this is causing you significant distress, and you're right to pay attention to these signals.\n\nWhat you're describing are indeed common signs of a substance use disorder, which many people understand as addiction. The key indicators here aren't just the frequency of use, but the negative consequences that follow: the paranoia and irritability that alter your behavior, the hurtful words said to your partner, and the persistent guilt and shame that linger even after a \"quiet\" night. Your body and mind are telling you that this pattern is no longer working for you, and that internal conflict is the source of much of that confusion and guilt.\n\nThe most important step you've already taken is recognizing the problem. My strong professional recommendation, as a counselor, would be to seek a confidential evaluation with a substance use specialist or therapist. They can help you understand the role cannabis is playing in your life, whether it meets clinical criteria for a disorder, and most importantly, work with you on a plan to address it. This is especially important given the interpersonal strain; a therapist can also help you navigate repairing trust with your partner.\n\nIn the immediate term, I encourage you to practice some self-compassion. The guilt, while painful, is a sign of your values and your care for your relationship. Instead of letting the shame cycle push you toward more use, try to see it as a motivator for change. You might consider writing down the specific regrets or hurtful things said, not to dwell on them, but to make concrete the reasons you want to shift this pattern.

I felt kind of guilty but mostly because I know my parents wouldn't like it. My parents are very religious—they're Christians. We did things every time he'd come over to my house. We didn't have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when we'd watch movies by ourselves. One day, my parents found out I did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. As soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. They were both aggravated. They told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. They said he wanted me for sex and he's not a Christian. I took their advice and broke up with him. Once we broke up for about a month, I decided to get back together with him a little after school started. My parents found out eventually, and I decided to not listen this time. I would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and God totally forbids him. I would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually I would just never listen to my parents. They're always yelling at me about how I shouldn't date this boy. I felt too old to listen to them. Now I'm kind of just stuck. Is the real me religious? Have I been brainwashed by him? I don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think I'm deceiving because of it. They threatened me that if I'm still with him, I can't do track and they won't support me.

What you're describing sounds incredibly painful and isolating, carrying this grief for a decade while also trying to hold your marriage together. It's completely understandable to feel desperate to save your family; that speaks to your deep love and commitment. The cyclical nature of his withdrawal around anniversaries, and now this new development with his friend, adds layers of hurt and uncertainty to an already profound loss.\n\nFirst, I want to validate that your grief, and your need for a partner in that grief, are just as important as his. The loss of your son created a wound in your relationship, and it seems you've both been coping in very different, and now disconnected, ways. His emotional distance and the threat of leaving are likely expressions of his own unbearable pain, but that does not make their impact on you any less real or damaging.\n\nWhile your willingness to overlook the emotional affair to preserve the family is a testament to your strength, I am concerned that this approach may further erode your own well-being and the marriage's foundation. \"Overlooking\" often means burying legitimate hurt, which can lead to resentment. The core issue isn't necessarily this friend, but the decade of unresolved, shared grief that has created a chasm between you.\n\nFor this reason, I strongly recommend seeking professional help together. A therapist specializing in grief and couples counseling can provide a safe, structured space for you both to express your pain, perhaps for the first time in years, and to learn how to support each other again.

It is actually quite common for one partner to have a higher sex drive than the other, and can lead to discord in the relationship. The good news is, there are ways to deal with this.You may have already answered your question. There are many medications that can alter one's sex drive. If your birth control pills are the cause of this, talk to your doctor about switching to a different brand. You may even consider alternate methods for birth control, such as condoms.However, there are some other things to ask yourself. First, you used the term \"affection\" but then talked about sex. They're not the same thing. There are different kinds of intimacy, and many different ways to show love for someone. A book you might find useful is \"The Five Love Languages\".Defining what \"affection\" means to you, and to him, and discovering all the ways you both can show this towards each other, may help lessen some of your anxiety over this.Humans are hard-wired to need appropriate physical touch. In fact, studies have shown that newborns/premies who can receive skin-on-skin contact with their parent can recover faster than babies who don't receive this touch. It's called Kangaroo Care. Children who have grown up in neglectful environments where they're not hugged and kissed and shown appropriate physical contact can often be unable to show this to their partners and children when they're adults. One question to ask yourself is, were you having intimacy issues before starting the medication? If so, there may be other, deeper issues at play here.For someone who has received the wrong kind of sexual/physical touch (sexual abuse, physical beatings) it can be difficult to allow someone to be physically close to you. A therapist could help you work through this.Sometimes, a person may lose their sexual feelings for their partner due to issues in the relationship. Once those issues are resolved, the sex drive comes back. Examine your relationship and see if either of you are unhappy, if you've been arguing a lot, or if there are any problems in your relationship that need to be addressed.Finally, look for the other ways that the two of you may be intimate in a non-sexual way. You may be doing things for each other that you don't even realize, and noticing these will help you appreciate it more. Take the stress off of the sexual gratification and focus on showing your love in other ways. Some people like to give gifts, do the other person's chores, or do other things they think the person will appreciate.If, after all of this, you still have a discrepancy with one of you having a higher sex drive, there are many articles online that offer advice for couples dealing with this situation that you may find useful.

There are many coping mechanisms for binge eating and one of the best is actually attempting to NORMALIZE eating. Meaning you need to attempt to eat normally, eating appropriately portioned meals 3 times a day, with snacks in between. IF you binge, then it may be helpful to remind yourself that when you attempt to compensate for your bingeing behaviors, and you end up feeling restricted from over exercising or undereating, then this actually leads to a binge again. Thus, reverting you back to the cycle. If you binge, it will be helpful to try and get back on a normal schedule of eating instead of trying to compensate for the binge. Although it may feel counterproductive, getting back on a normal eating schedule will prevent you from entering into the restrictive cycle. It can also be helpful to remind yourself that the binge has already occurred, it is in the past and the goal is to move forward without focusing on the past. Focus on what you can do differently next time. What emotions or situations led up to the binge? What can you to do prevent or change the circumstances that led to the binge, or the way that you handled the situation? Lastly, if you're struggling with \"normalizing\" eating, it can be helpful to work with a professional that can provide counseling and coaching to help you learn how to eating normally, mindfully and without feeling the guilt and other harmful emotions sometimes associated with disordered eating.

These behaviors are not a normal or healthy part of a relationship, even during stressful times like job loss. Your safety and emotional well-being, and that of your child, are the absolute priority.\n\nIt is a positive step that your partner has agreed to therapy. However, given the dynamic you've described, I strongly recommend that you seek individual counseling for yourself first. A therapist can be a crucial support for you, help you process your experience, and develop a safety plan. They can also help you navigate the language barrier concern, as many therapists can work with interpreters or have strategies to ensure you are heard. When considering couples therapy, it's vital to proceed with caution; it is not recommended in situations involving intimidation or threats, as it can sometimes escalate risk.\n\nFor now, please consider these steps:\n1. **Safety Planning:** Identify a safe place you and your child can go if tensions escalate. Keep important documents, some cash, and a bag with essentials accessible.\n2. **Local Support:** Please contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or visit thehotline.org. They offer free, confidential support in many languages and can connect you to local resources.\n3. **Document Incidents:** Keep a private record of concerning interactions, including dates and what was said or done.\n\nYou are not alone in this.

It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that things aren't going well and to want to make changes. Here are some suggestions that may help:\n\n1.  **Seek support for yourself:** Reach out to friends, family, or a therapist who can offer emotional support and help you process your feelings. Consider joining a support group for partners of people with anger issues or for non-native English speakers to find people who understand your challenges.\n2.  **Practice assertive communication:** When you feel the urge to express yourself, try to use \"I\" statements to describe how his behavior affects you. For example, \"I feel hurt when you belittle me. Can we talk about what's going on?\" instead of \"You always belittle me.\" This can help your partner see the impact of their words.\n3.  **Set boundaries:** If your partner threatens to leave you stranded, set clear boundaries about what you're and aren't comfortable with. You can say, \"I need you to communicate with me when you're upset, and we need to work through this together. If you leave, I'll make arrangements for our child.\"\n4.  **Encourage your partner to communicate:** S", "topic": "domestic-violence", "judge_reason": "Response A demonstrates superior empathy, prioritizes safety by addressing concerning behaviors directly, provides specific safety planning and resources, follows professional best practices by recommending individual therapy first, and maintains appropriate boundaries.

Do we have grounds for a lawsuit?", "chosen": "I am so deeply sorry for the loss of your friend.

It is profoundly painful to lose someone in this way, especially with the added layer of questions about what might have been done differently. Please know that your care for your friend and your search for answers in the wake of this tragedy speaks to your deep compassion.\n\nAs a counselor, my role is to support you through this grief, not to provide legal advice. The question of accountability and legal grounds is a complex one that depends entirely on the specific laws in your state, the contractual agreements of the sober living home, and the details of their policies. What I can advise is that these are questions for a qualified attorney who specializes in wrongful death or personal injury law. They can review the case, determine if there was a breach of a legal duty of care, and advise you on whether there are grounds for a lawsuit.\n\nWhile you explore these practical questions, I gently encourage you to also tend to your emotional well-being. A loss like this can bring up intense and complicated emotions. Speaking with a grief counselor or therapist, either individually or in a support group for those who have lost loved ones to addiction, can be an invaluable source of support.

Have you talked with your boyfriend about this struggle you're feeling? It can be hard to have this kind of conversation without triggering a sense of blame and subsequent defensiveness in our partners, but it really is possible.
