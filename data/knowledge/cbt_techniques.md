# Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Techniques

## Overview

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. It is highly effective for treating anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions.

## Core Principles

### 1. Cognitive Triangle
The CBT model is based on the interconnection between:
- **Thoughts**: Our interpretations of situations
- **Feelings**: Emotional responses to thoughts
- **Behaviors**: Actions we take based on thoughts and feelings

Changing one element affects the others, creating opportunities for intervention.

### 2. Cognitive Distortions
Common thinking errors that contribute to emotional distress:

#### All-or-Nothing Thinking
Seeing things in black-and-white categories. If performance falls short of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure.
*Example*: "If I don't get an A, I'm a complete failure."

#### Catastrophizing
Expecting the worst possible outcome in any situation.
*Example*: "If I fail this test, my life is over."

#### Mind Reading
Assuming you know what others are thinking without evidence.
*Example*: "They're all judging me right now."

#### Fortune Telling
Predicting negative outcomes without realistic basis.
*Example*: "I know the interview will go terribly."

#### Emotional Reasoning
Believing that your emotions reflect reality.
*Example*: "I feel stupid, so I must be stupid."

#### Should Statements
Using rigid rules about how you or others should behave.
*Example*: "I should never make mistakes."

#### Personalization
Blaming yourself for things outside your control.
*Example*: "The team lost because of me."

#### Overgeneralization
Drawing broad conclusions from single events.
*Example*: "I failed once, so I'll always fail."

## Key CBT Techniques

### 1. Thought Records
A structured way to identify and challenge negative thoughts:
1. **Situation**: What happened?
2. **Automatic Thought**: What went through your mind?
3. **Emotion**: What did you feel? (Rate intensity 0-100)
4. **Evidence For**: Facts supporting the thought
5. **Evidence Against**: Facts contradicting the thought
6. **Balanced Thought**: A more realistic perspective
7. **Re-rate Emotion**: How do you feel now?

### 2. Behavioral Activation
For depression and low motivation:
- Schedule pleasurable activities
- Start with small, achievable goals
- Track mood before and after activities
- Gradually increase activity level

### 3. Exposure Therapy
For anxiety and phobias:
- Create a fear hierarchy (0-100 scale)
- Start with least anxiety-provoking situations
- Gradually work up the hierarchy
- Stay in situation until anxiety decreases
- Practice regularly

### 4. Problem-Solving Therapy
Structured approach to addressing life problems:
1. Define the problem clearly
2. Brainstorm solutions (without judgment)
3. Evaluate pros and cons of each
4. Choose and implement a solution
5. Evaluate the outcome

### 5. Relaxation Techniques
Physical approaches to reduce anxiety:
- **Deep Breathing**: Slow, diaphragmatic breathing
- **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**: Tensing and releasing muscle groups
- **Grounding**: Using senses to connect to present moment

### 6. Cognitive Restructuring
Process of challenging unhelpful thoughts:
1. Identify the negative thought
2. Examine the evidence
3. Consider alternative explanations
4. Develop a balanced perspective
5. Practice the new thought
