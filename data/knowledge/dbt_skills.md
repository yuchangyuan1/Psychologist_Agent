# Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Skills

## Overview

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) was developed by Marsha Linehan to treat borderline personality disorder but is now used for various conditions including depression, anxiety, PTSD, and emotional dysregulation. DBT combines cognitive-behavioral techniques with mindfulness practices.

## The Four DBT Skill Modules

### 1. Mindfulness Skills

The foundation of all DBT skills - being fully present in the moment.

#### Core Mindfulness States
- **Reasonable Mind**: Logical, fact-based thinking
- **Emotion Mind**: Feeling-driven, impulsive reactions
- **Wise Mind**: Integration of both - intuitive knowing that feels right

#### "What" Skills
- **Observe**: Notice experience without words
- **Describe**: Put words on experience
- **Participate**: Throw yourself into the moment fully

#### "How" Skills
- **Non-judgmentally**: See, don't evaluate. Focus on facts.
- **One-mindfully**: Do one thing at a time
- **Effectively**: Do what works for the situation

### 2. Distress Tolerance Skills

For crisis survival without making things worse.

#### TIPP Skills (Change Body Chemistry)
- **T**emperature: Cold water on face activates dive reflex
- **I**ntense Exercise: Brief, intense physical activity
- **P**aced Breathing: Slow, deep breathing

#### ACCEPTS Skills (Distraction)
- **A**ctivities: Engage in hobbies or tasks

#### Radical Acceptance
- Completely accepting reality as it is
- Not approval, just acknowledgment of facts
- Reduces suffering added by fighting reality
- "It is what it is, and I can cope with it"

### 3. Emotion Regulation Skills

For understanding and managing emotions.

#### Understanding Emotions
- All emotions have a function
- Emotions are neither good nor bad
- Emotions can be changed

#### Reducing Vulnerability (PLEASE)

- **L**ow mood medications: Take as prescribed
- **E**ating: Balanced meals
- **A**void mood-altering substances
- **S**leep: Regular sleep schedule
- **E**xercise: Regular physical activity

#### Build Positive Experiences
- **Short-term**: Do one pleasant thing daily
- **Long-term**: Work toward life worth living goals
- Be mindful of positive experiences

#### Build Mastery
- Do something that makes you feel competent and in control
- Plan for success, not failure
- Gradually increase difficulty

#### Opposite Action
When emotion doesn't fit the facts:
- **Fear** → Approach
- **Anger** → Be gentle, validate the other person
- **Sadness** → Get active, reach out
- **Shame** → Share with supportive others
- **Guilt** → Repair, if appropriate

#### Check the Facts
Before acting on emotion:
1. What is the emotion?
2. What triggered it?
3. What are my interpretations?
4. What are the actual facts?
5. Does the emotion fit the facts?

### 4. Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills

For maintaining relationships while meeting needs.
