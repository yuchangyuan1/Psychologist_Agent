I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years. I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?", "answer": "It is very common for people to have multiple issues that they want to (and need to) address in counseling. I have had clients ask that same question and through more exploration, there is often an underlying fear that they \"can't be helped\" or that they will \"be too much for their therapist.\" I don't know if any of this rings true for you. But, most people have more than one problem in their lives and more often than not, people have numerous significant stressors in their lives. Let's face it, life can be complicated! Therapists are completely ready and equipped to handle all of the issues small or large that a client presents in session. Most therapists over the first couple of sessions will help you prioritize the issues you are facing so that you start addressing the issues that are causing you the most distress. You can never have too many issues to address in counseling. All of the issues you mention above can be successfully worked through in counseling.", "topic": "depression"}

I want her to stay.", "answer": "You're probably not going to like my answer.Your question says a lot about what YOU want rather than what she wants or what may be best for her. Sometimes, what's best for a person is the hardest thing to do, and may be completely opposite of what YOU want.Addictions don't happen in a vacuum. If you've had any experience with addicts at all, then I'm sure you've heard the term \"enabler\". A lot of the times, when people think they're \"helping\", they're actually enabling the addict to continue their self-destructive behavior. Tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations, but especially with addictions. Family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to use/drink, continuing to do so, or relapsing back into it.You said she recently quit. You said she is depressed. She wants to move. When a person receives counseling for addictions, they are encouraged to make changes like this. They need to break the habit, and this means removing people from their lives at times. It means moving to new locations. Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed. Not only that, but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they use/drink in the first place, and not only break the physical addiction to it, but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place. She may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person, time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy.Don't pressure her to stay. Let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do. If she stays, the decision needs to be hers and hers alone. It doesn't need to be made under pressure. That will only lead to resentment. Support her, but don't try to change her or make her do anything, especially for selfish reasons. Let her go. It sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now.

Emotionally, it's an exhausting condition and can take a lot of energy from the body. Depression is a common consequence of PTSD since many people experience functional repercussions (impacts in work, social, and familial settings). It's not fun to feel constantly terrified. To search for a therapist trained in what you are dealing with, it could be helpful to specifically search for folks who specialize in treating PTSD. You can do that through Google searches, or you can also head over to Psychology Today and Therapy Den.

I haven't be in counseling lately though.", "answer": "Thanks for reaching out with this important question!To start, I'll say the diagnosis for depression can differ depending on what the context of those markers are. For example, depression is diagnosed differently if there's a bipolar element or if someone is withdrawing from drugs or alcohol. It doesn't sound like that's what you're experiencing, but those are just two examples of many. How that's diagnosed is a process that a therapist is best equipped to do in person with a thorough assessment. Sometimes we find that depression is subclinical, meaning it doesn't reach the typical level of \"disorder\" (that doesn't mean it's less important or worthy of care). Most of the time, diagnosis doesn't make a huge difference in treatment, but there are some disorders that need pretty specific modalities and components--for example, people with Bipolar I often need medication to help stabilize symptoms.I'd also say that, more importantly, you know yourself best. You are clearly trying to make sense of some things you are feeling and maybe how they are connected to some things you've been through. I can also see you are motivated to feel better! No matter what others think, your perceptions and experiences are most important. You get to decide whether or not your circumstances are a lot for you. Not everyone is built the same and that is certainly impacted by trauma and significant stressors in the developmental years. It's also not your fault that things are hard. You didn't ask for, nor did you create, your life experiences.Overall, if you know some of your healing may come from naming what you feel you can absolutely continue to seek out solid information (and maybe that will be with a counselor if that's what you desire).

I am devastated and cannot find a cause for these issues. I am very attracted to my wife and want to express it in the bedroom like I used to. What could be causing this, and what can I do about it?", "answer": "First step always is to do a medical rule out so that you're sure the problem is psychological and emotion based, not a medical condition which requires care and attention.If you are medically clear in the reasons for losing your erection, then reflect on what may be creating a loss in confidence in either who you are and what you're doing with your life, or whether your wife has these sort of problems within herself.Often a problem transfers ownership of who shows it.If you are a sensitive person its possible your erection problem reflects your wife's insecurities and self-doubt. If she is someone who is reluctant to talk about feeling unsure then in a certain way by you showing a problem, she can avoid looking at herself.There may not be a direct cause such as usually exists in a medical problem.Medicine looks for symptoms to treat.Our emotional lives are much more indirect.If you feel stress at work or are unhappy in the place you live, for example, then your frustration may show up in your sex life.Basically, do a broad inward search of your life and what it holds and maybe ask your wife to do the same.You may clear the air within yourselves and between each other so the problem goes away.", "topic": "depression"}

{"id": "counsel_00013", "question": "Every winter I find myself getting sad because of the weather. How can I fight this?", "answer": "Seasonal Affective Disorder (S.A.D.) is a term that reflects how many people are affected by the changing seasons, especially fall to winter. Everyone suffers with some form of this (lessened activity levels, increased isolation, etc.) while some find that this time of year can put them into a deeper depression. If you have noticed that this happens frequently, there are some ways you can definitely help yourself going forward:1. Attend therapy to learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood. It's important to stay within the therapy until you feel you have mastered these tools. 2. Push yourself to interact more with your social groups and other positive activities. It's easy to go out and spend the day outside in the summer months, when the temperature is warm and the sun shines for long periods of the day, but it seems harder to find fun ways to spend your time when the temperature drops and darkness comes on so quickly. Perhaps winter time could become the time of year where you and your friends have weekly board game nights, complete with hot chocolate and a fire?3. You may want to consider the purchase of a S.A.D.

When I am stressed, overwhelmed, hurt, or angry, the urge to self-harm is all I can think of. I am trying to seek help.", "answer": "Glad you are reaching out here!There are two types of self-harm: suicidal and non-suicidal. A lot of people I see and have seen engage in self-harm just to manage emotional dysregulation, but not to end their lives. Self-injury actually does a great job at helping us to manage really intense emotional states--even from a chemical level in the body. When you self-harm, it's triggers your body's endorphin production, which is a chemical that makes us feel good. I'm not saying you should do it, but I understand why you would choose that option because it is pretty powerful.To answer your question, I've never heard of anyone being admitted into inpatient for trying to stop non-suicidal self-injuring. Even some people I've worked with that are suicidal and self-harming have remained outpatient given we have an extensive safety plan, including how to reach out for help and coping skill development. Unless you are at high risk of suicide, you would most likely be outpatient. I also work from a harm reduction model, meaning that if you have to self-harm it might as well be as safe as possible. When people are trying to stop, sometimes the pressure gets in the way and they relapse (very normal and actually expected). So we prepare for that by discussing measures to take to make sure the method you use is very safe. Things here include making sure anything piercing the skin is properly disinfected, areas on the body to avoid cutting, and self-harm alternatives that still cause pain but are much safer. For example, some people hold ice in the palm of their hands, or snap rubber bands on their wrists. There are many websites that have safer alternatives as well if you just do a quick google search. Have patience with yourself here, too. You've found a way to manage a whole lot of emotions--and it's worked for you--you did that by yourself! You also want better for yourself and have made the first steps for change and that's really spectacular. It'll be similar to quitting any habit, so stick in there.

If you feel sad on most days, it is worthwhile speaking to a psychologist to determine whether you suffer clinical depression. Feeling sadness is a normal response to loss, whether you lose a family, friend, job, or something you deem important in your life. However, feeling sadness all the time is a signal that you are not happy about something in your life. If it is related to your family and often relationship with family members could affect our self-esteem and self-worth, then perhaps it is worthwhile exploring what you find unhappy about your relationship with your family. Is it that you do not feel heard, supported or loved? Is it that you feel disrespected, disregarded or feel unimportant? These are just a few examples of common issues that people report that contribute to their depression. To help you to uncover your reasons for your sadness or depression and to cope with them in a healthier and more constructive way, it may be helpful to contact a therapist who could support you with this process.

I’m always alone with no friends.", "answer": "Seems like you've really been through the ringer without much of a break. Just reading through the details you put in the question, I hear a couple things. One is that you seem like a helper. That's not bad at all, though other people taking advantage of your nurturing qualities and not giving that back to yourself can really zap your energy. Seems like you were the one that had to take care of your ex for a very long time. Think about what that takes--a lot of patience, great emotional awareness, flexibility to adjust to needs and change plans, etc. What that also means is that you probably had to focus so heavily on him that you weren't able to give any of that attention to yourself. The great part is that it doesn't look a whole lot different when you give that to you vs someone else. Self-love and self-care is a really important piece of managing anxiety (and depression), as you learned with your ex.The other thing I noticed is that it sounds like you maybe tend to people-please. This is common with people that are helpers--they are almost a package deal. People-pleasing is really about abandonment. It's derived from a fear that if you aren't exactly what people need, they may have negative feelings toward you and ultimately abandon or reject you. May also stem from a need for peace if you grew up in a chaotic home (common with kiddos from domestic violence backgrounds), though that usually has some type of connection to abandonment as well.As far as anxiety management goes, there's so much you can do. It's hard to say what will work specifically for you, but first thing that might help is to understand your triggers. What gives you anxiety? Is it general and seems to come out of nowhere? Or does it buildup and get worse at a certain time of day? I find that many people who have unresolved grief and depression tend to cycle through those symptoms and anxiety because there's so much stress and pressure involved in the cluster of issues that those circumstances tend to bring. Sorting those things out can be tough---if you need help from a friend or counselor, it's never too late to reach out. It doesn't matter if it happened last week or 10 years ago. If it matters to you, it's relevant.I hope some of this helps and you are able to find someone in your life to lean on. You aren't meant to be alone!", "topic": "depression"}

However, if you're feeling overwhelmed by racing thoughts, feeling like you spend a lot of energy worrying about something specific or even pretty much anything at all, and you're starting to find that it's getting in your way when it comes to living your life the way you want, then I'd suggest seeing a counselor or therapist for an assessment for anxiety. Your other concerns, though, seem pretty \"normal\" for someone who is in a relationship with a partner who has children. As a married stepmother, I've been there, and as a therapist, I can tell you that the boundaries and communication skills you have in your relationships need to be healthy for you to feel healthy. Finding some support from a group of others whose partners have children might be really helpful - being able to hear from others that you aren't alone in feeling like this can really lighten the load, and they might have some good ideas for handling certain situations. Another option is to find a counselor or therapist who has experience working with step/blended family dynamics - because even if you're not officially married, those dynamics come into play whenever there are kids from another relationship involved. You may even consider couples counseling so that both of you can learn to talk about your relationship needs and concerns in a way that will encourage connection and strengthen your sense of partnership.", "topic": "depression"}

I think it's great you've already tried a few things to help yourself sleep, even if they don't work. Those methods of coping could be targeting something other than paranoia--which is maybe why you aren't finding those things are helpful. If you are really struggling, sometimes meds can help to calm the brain a bit. If you choose this route, make sure you give your prescribing doctor all the information about your symptoms so your meds can be as accurate as possible for what you're dealing with.If you have access, counseling could be beneficial as well. There are more and more counselors becoming available via telehealth because of COVID, so you could even find someone to help you right in the space you feel most paranoid about (given that space is private).

{"id": "counsel_00037", "question": "I have an alcoholic son who is draining me financially. I want to get him help, but he doesn't want help. It's making me anxious and depressed.", "answer": "What a heavy situation to be in. It must be really hard to feel like you aren't able to help your son and the help you do try to give isn't truly helping him or you. There's some things in this situation that are out of your control--what your son does, if he takes help or doesn't, and the feelings that come up for you about that. I can only imagine how draining it would be as a parent to be unable to change something so important. It makes sense you'd be feeling anxious and depressed.Let's switch for a minute to the things you have total control over--what are those things in this situation? Maybe that's how you express your love for your son. Or maybe it's how you choose to support him (even if it feels like it's a betrayal to him). Pay attention as well to the amount of worry you experience--how much of that helps you plan vs how much of that is excess? Knowing what worry isn't necessary can help to put you in control of how you spend some of your time. You can replace this time with some self-care instead, giving back to yourself.Finding support groups or people that have similar situations can be very helpful. I'd say they are almost necessary. Knowing other people get what you are going through and understand the emotional toll can be somewhat healing. They may also know other resources or ideas you can try that are available to people in your situation.Something else to consider is grief work. Letting go of some or all of the situation with your son (if that's what it comes down to) is a giant loss. You probably already went through losing who your son was before the addiction, so it could be worth exploring the impact that had and has on you.", "topic": "depression"}

How do I tell them this and ask for therapy?", "answer": "Talking with parents can be very challenging, even if they are loving and understanding. Have you ever discussed these issues in the past? If so, how did they respond? It'd make sense if you were avoiding a discussion if they have responded negatively to you, or even neutrally. We rely on our parents for action when we are in need and it can feel so disappointing when they don't meet our needs. If this is the case for you, you could still reach out to them if you feel safe to. That might mean being very candid about what you need from them or what you are seeking for yourself. Sounds like you already know you are struggling and you want to get some help which is awesome.Do you worry they won't believe you? Or that they'll be disappointed in you for self-harming? If you are struggling with these worries, it may be worth talking to another trusted adult about how to bring the issues up to your parents. Maybe that adult could be part of the conversation if appropriate or available? Also, do you have any siblings that are old enough to be part of the conversation? Or maybe be a shoulder to lean on? No matter what happens, social support is really important so you don't have to go through it all alone.Is it possible that your parents or even one of your parents will be proud of you for speaking up for yourself and trying to get help? Sometimes depression and anxiety immobilizes us because we fear the worst, when in reality there are many more possibilities. One of the things I have my teen clients work on if they want to communicate something to a caregiver is have them come up with a bullet-point list of the things they need them to know. So maybe your list would include symptoms you've been struggling with, how you want to change, and what you need from them to help you change. If you do this and it doesn't turn out well, remember that it's on them and not you. Sometimes parents are doing the best they can, and sometimes it's not good enough. That never means you aren't worth helping. It could be helpful to make a backup plan for how you will try to reach out to someone if they don't respond well.You also don't specify your age, or if you are even a teen. I'm assuming you are, but if not, you may be able to get help without their consent or help. If you are closer to age 18, you may not have long to wait.

I have no clue how to help him take his mind off the negative, or to distract him into a different light. How do I help him?", "answer": "That's a giant task to have to do all on your own. It's hard to watch someone you care about feel depressed and I'm guessing it brings you down, too. Change is tricky. Most people need to hit a \"rock bottom\" before they can transform their lives. Rock bottom is a moving target though--meaning one person's rock bottom could look completely different than someone else's. For some people that's a trip to the hospital, for others it's failing an exam. It's about what brings up enough discomfort (with awareness of why) with the current way of living that not changing would be more painful.Depression is so hard, but it can also be weirdly comforting. It sucks to feel sad, but at least you know what to expect. He knows that he's going to get high, zone out into his phone, and his anger is probably pretty predictable. On the other hand, change is uncertain. Is he open to seeing a therapist? Or open to trying anything new with you? If not, that's not your fault nor is it your responsibility. You obviously care, but that doesn't mean it's on you if he doesn't follow through. It seems like maybe he feels some comfort in the daily structure that you described, but even getting out for a walk could help his mindset a bit.

I'm interested to hear some more information; such as, if you live by yourself or family, if you go to school/employed/unemployed, and what kind of things do you like to do with friends or by yourself. Often times, when we are experiencing a strong emotion that we interpret as negative, we put most of our focus on that negative emotion and struggle to see that we do not always feel that specific emotion. There are typically points in the day (even if it is for only in 1 minute intervals) when we do not feel that negative emotion. When we overgeneralize, we use words like \"always\" or \"never\" and when we use those words and it may not be totally true, we feel the negative emotion based on an inaccuracy which is not fair to you. Ask yourself some of these questions: Am I being realistic when I'm overgeneralizing things? Have I ever noticed a short period of time that I wasn't feeling anxious? What do I notice when I am feeling anxious? What am I thinking about? When was the last time I felt empathy? What was different when I was able to feel empathy?

{"id": "counsel_00043", "question": "I have been feeling more and more down for over a month. I have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks, but they are almost never triggered by something that I know of.", "answer": "The first thing I usually recommend to clients that are coming in for these issues in addition to stress management is visiting their doctor. We really don't know if it's something psychological that's influencing your symptoms, or if there's other issues happening within the body. Pancreas or thyroid issues can perpetuate anxiety and depression symptoms pretty intensely--these are things your doctor knows more about and can help test for (and maybe rule out).As you probably already know, lack of sleep is a giant contributor to an increase in symptoms. We don't know too much about sleep in the research, but we do know it's necessary to function and function well. Some suggestions here from the research we do have: creating a calming routine at night can help with your body's relationship to sleep. This can be your normal nightly hygiene paired with some relaxing videos or soundscapes (there are apps for this--Calm, Headspace, PanicShield). Practicing these for a few weeks can help your brain pair your routine with sleeping. Another suggestion directly from the research is not to take naps. Yes, your brain needs sleep, but napping messes with our circadian rhythm and our quality/quantity of nightly sleep. When we sleep, we go through sleep stages--but when we nap, those stages aren't completed like they would be during a full night of sleep where we go through those stages multiple times. Both deep sleep and REM sleep (typically when we dream) seems to be especially important for feeling rested. Napping usually only offers us a small dose of that, whereas a full night can offer as many more completed cycles including both these stages. If you are waking into a panic attack, this site may give you some info on what that means: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/panic-attacks/expert-answers/panic-attacks/faq-20057984.

Now he is depressed and hopeless again.", "answer": "Hello, and thank you for your question. This is a very serious time. I don't mean to frighten you, but you are right to be concerned. The time right after people leave the hospital after receiving psychiatric services is a time of high risk for suicide. It is very important, after hospitalization, to get follow-up care with a professional as soon as possible. If your husband has an established therapist, this is the time to call. It is also a good time to alert your support system of friends, family, clergy or others to let them know he is still struggling. This is good support for him AND you.It is important to think about means and opportunity to make another attempt. Means really do matter. So, if you have a firearm in the home, it is really important to remove it. You can't remove all things that a person may hurt themselves with, but some things are more lethal than others. Firearms are very lethal. I am not sure what means he used last time, but try to reduce the opportunity for him to access it again. This is where your support system can help out. People can take turns hanging out with him until you are sure the crisis is over.If you believe that an attempt is going to occur, talk to your husband about going back to the hospital. If he refuses, you will want to find out what your options are to have him go even if he doesn't want to. I know the thought of that really hurts, but it can save his life. Calling 9-1-1 is always a good option if you are not sure. Usually a suicide crisis, meaning they want to harm themselves right now, lasts a few minutes, hours or days. Sometimes when you get them through the crisis stage, they no longer want to commit suicide. But, as you are indicating, that feeling of wanting to commit suicide can come back again. So, it is always good to have a plan. If you want more information, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. They will always answer: 1-800-273-8255.

Then when I see something sad or depressing, I automatically want to self-harm.", "answer": "In a way, self-harm can present somewhat like an addiction. According to new research within the field of neuroscience there is a valid explanation for this. When a person cuts or uses other forms of self harm, the body produces endorphins to help make a person feel better. If a person was dealing with depression or high anxiety, that might be misinterpreted by the brain as a way to help oneself feel better and a new neural network or map might form (addiction) that would utilize this new behavior. Another way to look at it would be thru a behavioral lens, a positive reward for a behavior, even though the behavior has other long term negative consequences. Consider working with someone who can both have you work on and address those items that trigger your behavior and the root causes, in this case sadness or depression, and second find someone who can help give you alternatives that take into account the neurological requirement by replacing the behavior with another behavior (such as snapping a rubber band on the wrist) and working to extinguish the unwanted behavior.

I'm just stuck, and I'm disappointed with my lack of accomplishments.", "answer": "If you are a people-pleaser type or a natural caretaker, you can slowly \"lose yourself\" over time if you are always tending to the needs of others and neglecting yourself. If this sounds like a familiar pattern for you, this may have happened without you even realizing it if you were raised in a family where you had to pick up the slack alot. Maybe your parents were addicts or they might have even just worked all the time and you learned to \"take care of everything\" because that is what you had to do to help the family run smoothly. Over time, a person who grows up in this type of environment learns that you put the needs of others before your own. You might also be stuck in these types of patterns in intimate relationships as well; if you completely give yourself over to your significant other and you don't create a life for yourself with your own interests and supportive friends, you are at risk of losing what is unique and amazing about you. If you grew up in a family where you learned this role out of survival or because it was needed to take care of your family, it's easy to re-create this in adult relationships.In both scenarios, if there is no awareness that this \"self sacrifice at the expense of others\" is going on, your identity is shaped around being a caretaker/enabler/people-pleaser and down the road it can lead to depression, low self esteem, and a confused sense of self. Basically, you spend so much time helping other people that you don't make time for yourself or create a life of fulfillment. Before you realize it, you have been living a life for others instead of yourself and you have no idea who YOU are. Supporting loved ones and friends is important and certainly admirable, but if you are always that person that rescues, those that rely on you begin to take advantage of you and they will suck you dry if you let them. In conclusion, learning to set boundaries with those in your life that are too needy becomes a really important part of the process when you begin to recognize that you are unhappy and unfulfilled in life. It sounds like you may be at that crossroads right now. Take one small step at at a time. Identify the worst offenders in your life that suck time and energy, and limit your contact and/or set some strong boundaries with those people so you can refocus and do some soul-searching.

Can counseling help?", "answer": "Thank you for asking this important question. I find that there are three steps to getting ready for treatment. Step one is expressing interest in wanting to receiving treatment for the outcome of positive behavioral change. Congratulations you did the first step! You are showing your readiness to start counseling by asking this question. Now the second step is to find a counselor who specializes in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression. The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression are a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Mindfulness, and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. Receiving meditation for your symptoms if part of the treatment, and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events. Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together shows the most effective outcome for Depression. The third step is to increase your positive self-talk to motivate yourself to attend treatment. As counselors, we are aware of the anxieties and fears that are associated with talking to a new professional for the first time. However, remind yourself that you are doing this to improve your well being. I hope this was helpful, and good luck with your treatment journey.", "topic": "depression"}

I suggested to him to get help and talk to his mom about it but he refuses.", "answer": "First of all, I can tell that you really care about your friend and I think it's great that you are reaching out with your concern. It's hard to determine whether your friend would meet the criteria for an official diagnosis of depression without working with him, however, whether he does or not, therapy may be beneficial for him in working through these difficult feelings and relational challenges.

El sentimiento viene y va todo el día. No sé qué está mal. No estoy seguro si estoy inventando los síntomas y problemas en mi cabeza o si algo realmente está mal. Los sentimientos son muy reales, y es muy poco probable que los estés inventando, por que los sentimientos son una respuesta tanto a los pensamientos que hay en nuestra cabeza, y, a las situaciones que nos ocurren día a día. Muchas veces pensamos que sentirnos triste está mal, y que solo debemos sentirnos alegres, pero todas las emociones tienen un propósito y razón de ser, tanto la alegría, como la tristeza, el coraje, la frustración, la excitación o el desespero, entre otros. No es bueno quedarnos estancados una emoción. Así que es importante aprender a identificar que causa nuestros sentimientos, como procesarlos para poder superar nuestras emociones y movernos de una experiencia a otra con más tranquilidad.

The important part is to recognize that you need help addressing those feelings and reaching out, which you are doing already. Having small conversations with your family is helpful, you can explain to them that you have been experiencing emotional discomfort and would like to talk to them about it. Since you been experiencing anxiety, panic attacks, and have thought about dying, It is VERY important that you ask them to help you make an appointment with a mental health professional.

Cuando intento hablar con mis padres, Me congelo y solo puedo hacer bromas porque nunca en mi vida hemos hablado de nuestros sentimientos. Entiendo que hablar de tus emociones puede hacernos sentir inadecuados, y bromear es una manera de manejar ese sentimiento incómodo, pero no hay forma correcta o incorrecta de hablar sobre tus sentimientos. Lo importante es reconocer que necesitas ayuda para manejarlos, y ya tu estas en ese proceso. Tener pequeñas conversaciones con tu familia te ayudara a explicarles los sentimientos que estas experimentando.

{"id": "counsel_00061", "question": "I'm constantly in a bad mood and I have no energy. Is that depression?", "answer": "Depression has many different signs and symptoms and looks different for every person. Often times people think depression is more about feeling \"sad,\" but depression can, in fact, express itself through irritability (or bad mood as you say) and lack of energy. According to the DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), depression includes the following symptoms:-Depressed mood-Irritable mood-Decreased interest or pleasure in activities you usually participate in or enjoy-Significant weight change or change in appetite-Change in sleep (insomnia or hypersomnia)-Psychomotor aggitation or retardation-Fatigue or loss in energy -Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt-Diminished ability to concentrate or indecisiveness-Thoughts of suicide or plan The great news is that there are many ways to improve depressive symptoms. If you are up for it, perhaps the best place to start is by seeing a physician or a therapist who can help determine how severe the depression is and can suggest methods of addressing the depression that fit your lifestyle, values, and capabilities. Good luck!", "topic": "depression"}
{"id": "counsel_00062", "question": "I'm a teenager and I I go through periods of moodiness. I have extreme feelings (but I bury them), and then I feel nothing - just empty and emotionless. I have trust issues, low self esteem,ban extreme fear of abandonment, and I constantly reevaluate my relationships. I also don't know who I am as a person. I'm not happy overall, but I'm not suicidal. Can I just feel happy?", "answer": "Sometimes the way to feel happy is to address all the questions you just described.Teenage years are the first time any of us starts to feel and recognize our uniqueness. The fact that you recognize your great range of feelings, as uncomfortable as they may sometimes be, is healthy.Also healthy is that you are asking for opinions of therapists who would be familiar with when a range of feelings shows an out of the ordinary problem.One path to take is to reflect on the topics you wrote here and especially to ask yourself your reasons for how the problem started and what it would take for it to resolve.Do you have trust issues because someone broke your trust? You're entitled to a repair of your trust by the other person. Even if the person never offers this to you, to know you deserve to be restored to whole, may help you feel more secure.The same is true with the other topics, abandonment and relationships generally.The more you continue to value your unique understanding, expectations, and standards, the more likely you'll create relationships which do not have these qualities, and you will restore your sense of hope that other people may treat you in a fair and kind way.", "topic": "depression"}

How can I deal with depression without telling anyone?", "answer": "Love yourself more and treat yourself kindly, with empathy and compassion.Usually when people feel depressed they also feel lonely and isolated. Since at this time you wouldn't want to tell anyone about the way you feel, which includes the possibility that a few of the ones whom you tell would offer you emotional support, give this to yourself.Also consider to make a goal of eventually telling someone whom you are reasonably sure would understand and empathize, about your depression.This will help alleviate the sense of shame, unworthiness and pervasive guilt which often comes along with depression.Sending you good luck!", "topic": "depression"}
{"id": "counsel_00064", "question": "How do I make myself happy without the people who made me happy? Now that they’re gone, I feel sad. It’s been two months now but I seem to be unable to stay okay and independent.", "answer": "Hello. So, someone made you happy but is no longer around? I am sure that feels devastating. As a counselor I usually have to ponder this kind of thought because it lends itself to suggesting that happiness comes from the external, rather than the internal side of a person's life. Happiness is formed within ourselves. All the external trappings of happiness are usually quite fleeting, and temporary. Even relationships fo not last forever. If we get to a place where we are reliant and dependent on those around us to create happiness in our lives, then we lose the opportunities for us to do it ourselves. We are entirely capable of finding ways to be happy. Sometimes this entails working out issues that are holding us back from reaching a place of peace, or resolution to a specific problem.What I would offer to you, is to find ways in which you can develop happiness for yourself. What do you like about your life as it is right now? What can you do to create change in your life to increase your happiness? These kinds of questions can be valuable to you as you seek out ways to make happiness an internal rather than an external event. Mourning the loss of a social connection (in whatever way that occurred), is part of the grieving process, but it is not permanent. It is a path to healing and moving forward. From this, you can seek out new sources of happiness. I encourage you to remember that happiness is independent of the external experience you have in the world. Happiness is an expression of the internal feelings, so that will be the source or the font of positive emotion from which you really draw. If you are lacking in happiness, then it becomes important to examine why that is, and what you can do about it to promote self-care. Seeking out a professional counselor can also be a good option as you move through the grief/loss process and examine the reasons happiness is not in greater supply.I wish you happiness for every day of your life.Best wishes.", "topic": "depression"}

It also sounds like current conflicts are continuing to leave you feeling hurt and devalued.

{"id": "counsel_00067", "question": "I am going through a very hard time and I'm so depressed. My parents are getting a divorce and a lot of bad things are happening. I want to lull myself.", "answer": "It sounds like a tough time and it's normal to feel down when your family is going through a divorce or other hardship. There's a difference between feelings like sadness, discouragement, grief, loneliness and depression, though. Sadness is sadness and sometimes we have to go through a grieving or other process, that is a normal reaction to events in our lives. Depression, on the other hand, is more about being stuck. Lulling yourself with self-care sounds like a healthy response and a way to give yourself support. So as to the uncomfortable but healthy part of your feelings, do the best you can to put names to it and share with a trusted other person. You will find comfort. The part of your situation that's depression -- feeling stuck, not able to get out of bad, concentrate, changes in sleeping and eating, loss of enjoyment in living, poor hygiene, feelings of hopelessness, that's different. First step, identify your own symptoms of depression. If you have any thoughts of hurting yourself, tell someone. If you're not sure, you can try 800-lifenet or other support line to get feedback. First aid for depression includes: daily care and feeding, good sleeping and eating, lots of exercise--even when you don't feel like it-- healthy socializing, and focusing on talking to yourself in a positive way. If you aren't able to move yourself out of your depression, work with a professional to make short-term goals and get some support. You may also talk to your doctor or psychiatrist about trying an anti-depressant to give you a little lift while you go through a rough patch.Best wishes,Karen", "topic": "depression"}
{"id": "counsel_00068", "question": "My depression has been reoccurring for a long time. It all started when I was being bullied in high school. In ninth grade, my principal told me I needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates. I needed professional help for my stress because I was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates. After that, I was fine for a couple of years. I entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work. I believe my depression re-booted from there with the stress. I began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her. Obviously, that wasn't the right choice. I regret ever doing that, seeing as even though I'm not self-harming anymore, I always look back at that time whenever I feel very stressed. I have a big problem with handling problems in life. Whenever a problem arises, I get stressed and I feel hopeless, as if it's not going to get better. I get way too stressed from my problems, which leads to overreacting a lot (especially when talking to others), which then leads to depression. I have a hard time coping with stress because I know that if I could handle it easily then I wouldn't be sad all the time, and I would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones.", "answer": "I couldn't help but notice that you did not specify your age, so I am unable to set the total chronological order and length that you have suffered in this way, but I want to start by commending you on seeking out additional coping techniques on your own. Unfortunately, it sounds like you were offered some that were more dangerous than helpful, but be proud that you were able to curb those before they caused too much harm. From what you have written, stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage. Often, when I am working with those who offer the same concern, there is a degree of people pleasing that comes with that stress. When we are trying to make others happy, especially when we are unable to distinguish the proper \"rules for success\", it can make even the simplest of tasks overwhelming. Stress management is just that, management; of our own anxieties about the needs of others, about our skills and the ability to complete a task and having multiple requests at any given time. Each of these aspects requires a separate sets of \"tools\" to manage them accordingly. For example, assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities, but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties. Try to separate the different areas of the problem, in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time. Perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your less-helpful responses to stress. For example, does a certain person's style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first? Is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity? Is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirements?Try to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you.", "topic": "depression"}

Often, we fall back on coping techniques that would be helpful in other problems (stress, social anxieties, etc.) for our depression, but the truth is that depression requires it's own little tool kit. Depression is all-encompassing, and, based on what you've written, the symptoms are already affecting work and your personal life in myriad ways. The best route forward would be to seek out counselling, admittedly, but if your insurance deductible is too high, that can be very expensive. I would recommend contacting your Employee Assistance Program (EAP) if offered by your employer. If not, you can look into community centres for counselling options, check if your doctor will give you a referral or your local religious organization. If, however, you are motivated to get your depression under control, there are some great workbooks out there that you can use on your own or with your therapist (as long as your therapist is trained in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, or CBT), such as \"Mind Over Mood\".", "topic": "depression"}
{"id": "counsel_00070", "question": "I always feel like I'm doing something wrong. Everything I do is crappy. I want to cry all the time. I can't eat or sleep.", "answer": "You are describing some of the most common symptoms of depression: low self esteem, difficulty sleeping, changes in appetite, sad mood, feelings of hopeless and feelings of worthlessness. A full assessment/evaluation with a mental health professional is warranted to understand if indeed you meet criteria for a Major Depressive Disorder i.e.., are delressed. One thing I often tell patients is that \"Do you think you are depressed?\" People often answer yes or no, but many individuals respond with a question: How would I know? To that I often explain that if I stopped watching movies or better, stopped enjoying watching movies that would be a clear indication for me that I am delressed. It would be a sign that I have lost pleasure or interest in the activity that I typically enjoy most . I'll ask you to think of one activity which you really really enjoy. It could be anything from reading, to being with friends, to skiing to watching tv. I would like to now ask you if you have stopped enjoying that activity or can't find the motivation to engage in it? This is another symptom of depression: loss in pleasurable activities. The good news is that there are many effective, available treatment if you are indeed in a depression or simply, you want to modify/decrease your depressive symptoms i.e., you want to stop feeling so tired and so worthless. Treatment includes one or more of the following: psychotherapy, medication, exercise. Any one or combination of both of these can help to improve your mood. The even better news is that feeling that you are doing something wrong can diminish with appropriate treatment over time. I hope you find this information helpful. The most important next step is to get evaluated by a mental health professional typically a psychologist or psychiatrist, and for both you and the professional to better understand your symptoms and your mood in the context of what is going on in your life.", "topic": "depression"}

It's exhausting pretending to be okay, and I don't know how much longer I can try. I'm just really tired, and sadly, I can't afford the help I need on my own.", "answer": "Hi Georgia, There's a really good lesson here. People tell us things, and we tend to think that's the truth...but it's not! I'll do some translating for you...\"You're so ungrateful\" means \"I need you to be successful and happy in order for me to feel I'm a good parent\".\"You're too young to be depressed\" means \"I don't want to deal with your mental health issues right now. I'll pretend it's not happening so I don't have to face my fear and shame\".\"It's only going to get worse\" just means \"I don't know how to support you beyond scaring you into wanting to at least fake happiness for my sake\".Your parents are being unsupportive, not because you're not suffering, but because this is all they're capable of right now. They are not where you will find the support you need, so keep looking for it in other places. It's out there. If might be an aunt or a friend, or a friend's aunt. It might be a therapist or a bus driver or your family doctor. Keep looking for someone who will hear you. I hope you don't ever give up. :)", "topic": "depression"}

Is that true? Am I supposed to respect the decision to leave because he can't handle what I'm going through and leaves me here crying and worried every night? He's constantly changing his mind on if he wants to work it out.", "answer": "Wow that is tough. There is nothing worse than fearing abandonment when you are already struggling with depression. It sounds like you are still wanting to work through whatever challenges you and your husband are having but your husband may not be on the same page. I would encourage you and your husband to seek professional support if you haven't already. While depression can put real strains on a relationship, relationship problems can lead to or contribute to depression and there may be some real benefits to both of you in doing some couple therapy. With that being said - if your husband is not willing to do therapy or is clear that he wants the relationship to end, then I can't see what choice you have but to \"respect his decision\" as you mentioned. This doesn't mean that you have to feel okay with the decision - as I'm sure you wouldn't - but ultimately loving one another and staying in committed relationships is a choice that we each have to make. If he is wanting to leave - this could make things a lot tougher for you. I would encourage you to seek professional support for yourself and reach out to lots of friends and family. You do not need to face depression alone - nor should you have to. We all need support at tough times like these.", "topic": "depression"}

{"id": "counsel_00075", "question": "Both of my parents committed suicide together, and I was the one who found them. I suffer from overwhelming depression, which is having an extreme effect on me and my husband’s sex lives. He does not understand at all and is always making me feel so uncomfortable about sex.", "answer": "Hello, and thank you for your question. First, I want to tell you how sorry I am for the experience you had with your parents. That is a grief and trauma that is certainly hard to imagine. Trauma and grief can affect us in many ways, and certainly deeply personal things like our sex lives. It may be difficult for others to make the connection, but it is there. So, for example, if stress and trauma make you feel like you are not interested in sex, a partner may take it as a personal rejection rather than response to stress, trauma or grief. If your husband will agree to it, couple's counseling may be your best bet. A counselor can help you with your communication and may be able to provide some education to your husband about trauma and how it can have an impact on intimacy. If he doesn't agree to go, it may be worth it to go on your own. You still have a lot you are dealing with yourself. And sometimes our personally therapy can influence others, so it may be a good idea. It is important to remember that even though you are married you have the right to make decisions about your body, and that includes when you want to have sex with it. I hope this is helpful, and some of my colleagues may have ideas, also. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC", "topic": "depression"}

If you're having difficulty sleeping, try to get into a habit of going to bed and waking up close to the same time every day. Also consider only using the bed for sleeping so your brain knows that it's time to sleep when you are in bed. If you are not sleeping while you are in bed, consider getting up and reading a book or doing something to make you tired before going back to bed. Hopefully you'll be able to establish a pattern.Sometimes sadness and other emotions make sleeping very difficult as well. Try keeping track of your moods to see what is leading up to the changes.If you're still struggling, consider talking with a therapist about the specifics and/or maybe talking with your primary care physician. There are natural sleep remedies that he or she may recommend for you.", "topic": "depression"}

You included a lot of things that you don't have. Is there anyway that you can have some freedom for a few hours a week, at least? A lot of times stay at home moms have groups when they meet at different public places where their children can play together and they can talk together. I don't know how old your child or children is/are, but perhaps going back to work is something that can happen in the future.I wonder if you may consider who you have in your life who can support you. I don't know whether you have a spouse or parents or siblings who could help out with some different things. I wonder if you could consider where you would like to go if you had two or three hours that you could do whatever you wanted? If you can sort out some possible answers to that, maybe you can work together with friends or family to make it happen.Also, again depending on the age of your children, some parents can do things while the children are sleeping, even if you are in the same room.

A therapist could be one person, but perhaps there is someone else in your life as well.One thing that may help is to find a bead or rock that is smooth and you can hold onto it while thinking of a specific memory where you were happy. This could be from as long ago as necessary as long as it is specific and you can place yourself back in that time when you are thinking about it. If you think about this time while holding onto the bead, the bead may remind you of a time when you felt happy.

In Pennsylvania, anyone over the age of 14 can provide consent for their own treatment. As for billing purposes, try talking to some local agencies. If you are under 18, you may be able to have Medicaid out of medical necessity so that you can have treatment. If you are over 18, there may be some discounted rates at some agencies because of the situation you're in.

You're also right that when you try to focus on just not cutting, it becomes more difficult because it's what you are focused on. While that is still something to work on, it may also be helpful to find something else you can do instead. You said drawing doesn't work for you.

So... if there was an opposite story...the very best story that someone could tell about you and your life...what would that be? Who would be telling it? Someone who loves you?

I feel like less of a person.", "answer": "It seems like you may be experiencing depression symptoms, they could be the triggered by unexpected life changes, or building up throughout time.The important part is that you have identified them and wanting to change them. The first step is to establish a self-care routine that will help you to feel centered and motivated: go for walks, or make any physical activity that you enjoy ( be kind to yourself, anything helps at this point), eat balanced, add whole grains and fibers to your diet, make a point to rest at night and avoid naps, practice a hobby that you love, or look for a new one that you are curious about. You mentioned that you feel unsettled in your soul: explore your spirituality, meditate about what makes your soul at peace, and find ways to practice that or surround yourself by those activities.If you find it difficult to begin, talk to your therapist to identify roadblocks and ways to find motivation. Suicidal and homicidal thoughts are common but serious depression symptoms, discuss them with your therapist, contact your doctor or psychiatrist, and call 9-1-1 if its and emergency.Once you feel stable, you can focus on exploring the source of the problem and see if you need to make changes or learn coping skills that will help you manage it. It will also be a good time to explore your spirituality and your purpose in life, that may help you to feel better with yourself and then happier around others.¿Cómo puedo volver a ser la persona que realmente soy?Siento que mi mente no está bien.

Siento que soy menos que los demás.Al parecer estas experimentando síntomas de depresión, la cual puede ser causada por cambios recientes en tu vida o estarse acumulando a través del tiempo.Lo importante en este momento es que tú reconoces los síntomas y estas buscando cambiar la situación. El primer paso sería trabajar en restablecer una rutina de cuidado personal que te ayude a sentirte emocionalmente estable y motivado: Sal a caminar o hacer alguna actividad física(ten compasión contigo mismo, cualquier cosa funciona para comenzar), comienza a comer balanceado, especialmente granos y fibras integrales, , procura descansar en las noches y evita las siestas, y practica algún tipo de actividad que hayas disfrutado en el pasado o que te de curiosidad. Mencionaste que tu espíritu esta intranquilo, explora tu espiritualidad, y que te ayudaría a encontrar la paz, busca la manera de hacer esa práctica una rutina.Si te cuesta mucho trabajo iniciar estas actividades, será bueno buscar a un consejero para que te ayude a identificar formas de estar motivado o obstáculos que te estén deteniendo. Es común tener pensamientos que atentan en contra de tu vida o la de otros, discútelos con tu terapeuta, con tu medico primario o psiquiatra, y llama al 9-1-1 si es una emergencia. Ya que consigas estabilidad, puedes comenzar a trabajar o explorar la causa del problema y ver si hay cambios mayores que debes hacer o destrezas que debes aprender para manejar el mismo.

There are many different reason why some may fear telling their parents. The most common thoughts I hear in my office are: \" My parents won't understand me\", I may cause more problems to the family\", \"I am worried that something bad may happen if I tell them\". If possible express your current concerns and worries to your parents. You can start the conversation with your parents by saying \"I have not been feeling like myself lately, and I may want to see a counselor\". I think you are doing the right thing by going on this website and asking for help. Just a helpful tip: positive self-talk can be beneficial before having difficult conversations with others. For example, tell yourself something positive before talking to your parents such as \"I feel confident in myself, and I am doing this to overcome my fear of talking to my parents\" can help to decrease the anxiety you are feeling leading up to the conversation.

Crying on Wednesdays may also be natural if some type of regular event or situation comes up for you then that you don't like, feel oppressed by and have no way of avoiding.Maybe you would qualify for a diagnosis for depression.This matters less than what you will do with a diagnosis.

{"id": "counsel_00094", "question": "I started having anxiety three months ago. I'm new to having anxiety, and it's making me depressed.", "answer": "One of the first steps is to manage anxiety and depression symptoms are to establish a good self-care routine. Start with the most basic things: Eating balanced meals, sleeping at from 6-8 hours and exercise at least 30 minutes a day. These will help you to regulate the chemical imbalance that affects your mood, plus exercising gives you time to vent and be distracted from your thoughts. Once basic self-care is established, I suggest that is a good time to start exploring the source of these feelings, and address them trough therapy. If you have difficulty initiating self-care routine talk to your therapist about what motivates you and pushes you to do things, you might find the key during the process. You could also contact your physician or a psychiatrist to discuss medication options if it’s too challenging to begin basic self-care.¿Cómo puedo controlar mi ansiedad?Uno de los primeros pasos para manejar la ansiedad y la depresión es establecer una buena rutina de cuidado personal. Comienza con las cosas más básicas: Comer comidas balanceadas, dormir de 6-8 horas en la noche, y ejercitarte por lo menos 30 minutos al día. Esto te ayudara a regular el desbalance químico que afecta tu estado de ánimo, además de que te da tiempo para desahogarte y distraerte. Ya que la rutina de cuidado eta establecida, es un buen momento para comenzar a explorar la fuente de tus sentimientos negativos, y explóralos a través de terapia. Si se dificulta comenzar a crear una rutina puedes consultar con tu terapista para identificar motivaciones que te impulsen a comenzar.

It certainly sounds like you don't like how things are going. Here are a few thoughts and ideas:1. If you haven't seen a primary care provider in a while, you may want to. There are health conditions that can affect your mood and energy levels, even at your age. It doesn't hurt to get checked out. If they find the cause, they may be able to treat it and improve the symptoms. In addition, most primary care providers are trained to be able to manage medication for patients who have mild, moderate, and sometimes severe depression. So, don't be surprised if your primary care doctor offers to put you on an anti-depressant if they diagnose you with depression. Medication is not the only way to treat depression, but sometimes it is necessary depending on different factors.2. You may want to consider counseling, since it is another effective way to treat depression. A counselor will help you explore the factors that may be leading to depressive symptoms in the first place. This could include thoughts, behaviors, beliefs, life experiences, and other things. 3. Finally, to answer your question about whether these feelings are \"normal.\" These symptoms could be the sign of an underlying general health or mental health condition. It is important to remember that even if these symptoms are \"abnormal\" it doesn't mean that YOU are. Millions of people struggle with depression. So remember, the symptoms are the problem, not YOU.

{"id": "counsel_00096", "question": "I have a lot on my mind, but all I want to do is stay locked in my room and not socialize with anyone. Why do I feel so alone?", "answer": "It has been said that depression is often the result of a blocked goal. Often people struggle with both anxiety and depression but have difficulty determining which is the most important issue. For some, depression is the result of frequently blocked goals and when their predominant issues are evaluated, they discover that they are anxious (worried) about a lot of areas in their life but seem to find no relief. When there is no relief and there have been numerous attempts (either in their mind or in practical application) to resolve the anxiety, depression is often the result. In this type of case, depression is not the main or underlying issue. The anxiety is the underlying issue. Having \"a lot on my mind\" sounds like anxiety. Unresolved anxiety can lead to feelings of depression which are often associated with \"emptiness.\" In the question above, I would want to evaluate all of the issues surrounding having \"a lot on my mind\" and determine where these might be coming from. Has there been ongoing rejection from peers? From family? If so, why does this seem to be happening? Isolation is often a protective measure that one implements to avoid further pain. Where does that need to protect originate? Are there unmet needs from childhood? Are there traumatic life events that have created a need to self-protect as a defense mechanism? We can feel \"alone\" even when in a crow of people or at a party. This has nothing, in this case, to do with being around people. It has more to do with how we view ourselves. If there is a prevailing message or script that has been internalized that says, \"You are worth nothing\" or \"You don't deserve the company of others\" then being around people will not alleviate the problem but only exacerbate it. I would want to evaluate how one feels about themselves and what negative messages one has received and has repeated to oneself over time. The Developmental Needs Meeting Strategy is a therapy aimed at addressing unmet childhood needs. If there is specific trauma that is associated with socializing with people, then EMDR can be very helpful in desensitizing and reprocessing the trauma. Looking at whether this individual's issue with emptiness is straight depression or whether it is depression as a result of unresolved anxiety is key to determining a treatment strategy.", "topic": "depression"}

Then the brother is asked why he's so happy in a room full of manure, and he says \"With all this sh-t, there's gotta be a pony in here somewhere!\"Happiness is a state of mind, and I hear you saying that you used to be happy, so maybe this means you believe it's possible. That's a wonderful start.Research on depression shows us that it is very linked to pessimism. You say \"I always see the worst end of things\". That's pessimism. Life is like an elephant. If all you see is roughness, backup and walk around; the view will change. The key to optimism is to build your ability to see the bad things in life as 1. temporary (this will pass. I know how to fix friendships), 2. Specific (not involving the whole of your life), and 3. not your fault (tons of people fail road tests). On the flip side, it helps if we can see good things as 1. more permanent, 2. bleeding into other areas of our lives, and 3. something YOU created. Not taking credit for good things and blaming yourself for the bad ones is typical especially of women. The feelings you are having are temporary; you're in a slump and it's a good time to sit down and look at how you can make the picture look different. I think you know how; but you lack energy right now. If tackling this on your own isn't enough, a therapist can help you take that step back to look at the big picture and help you rebuild your natural resilience and capacity for joy. I wish you the best.", "topic": "depression"}
{"id": "counsel_00100", "question": "I was anxious to go to middle school. I was afraid of what people might say about me, so when school started, I wasn't acting like myself. I was quiet, which I'm usually not. I didn't talk to anybody and didn't have any friends. Then a few years later, my grandma died. I really became depressed and stop going to school for a little. I hated myself and still do. I just need help. I need someone to care for me. I need someone to show that they care.", "answer": "I agree; you need more care and support. No one deserves to feel alone, or like they hate themselves. We're all wonderful, imperfect, complicated people and we're at our best when we're all helping each other. I'm glad you wrote this question, because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes. I can tell that you're smart, because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connected...you \"not being yourself\", and then how you felt when your grandma died. When Grandma died, you needed and deserved extra love and support, but the people around you didn't seem to give it to you, maybe. My hunch is that they wanted to, but that they didn't know how much you needed it, or what you needed exactly. The older you get, the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need. Maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature, but that's how it works. When you started middle school, it sounds like you changed; you got more quiet, right? That must have felt weird, to not be acting like yourself. It sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people wouldn't like you. Fear can be silly. So then, fear got you to not show yourself, and when we don't show ourselves, people can't see who we are; they don't know us as well and then they don't know what we need and they can't care for us as well either. Fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you. It does that to a lot of us. So, where you're at right now is because of what fear did to you, and also because when Grandma died you were already isolated so people couldn't see your pain and know that you needed support. There's a simple solution, but you'd have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say \"Get off my back!\". \"You're not helping me by telling me lies.\" Can you be brave enough to go back to your old, louder, self? If you talk to the people closest to you...tell them what you think and how you feel, then they'll be able to give you the care that you want and deserve.

This is giving me a lot of guilt and depression.", "answer": "Hi Tennessee, There is nothing wrong with you. There are many good reasons why you didn't say no. You didn't say no because you were caught off guard and unprepared; there is no place in life that teaches girls or boys how to manage it when someone crashes a sexual boundary. You also live in a culture where girls are encouraged to be cooperative and not upset people, and to put the needs of other people first. You instinctively want people to like you, and people can be very coercive sexually. You said it yourself; you \"gave in\". He wore you down.There's nothing wrong with you. It wasn't your job to say no. Women aren't the gatekeepers of male sexual urges. It was his job to get your consent first. He pressured you into it. A good therapist would help you to dig deep and uncover all these barriers to saying no and more. If you said no, what might happen then? What might that mean about you? What are you avoiding feeling? Unloved, unwanted, cold? What would you have to believe in order to be confident enough to say no? That you didn't have to do anything you don't want to do? That you're special, or that sexuality is special? Would you need a better understanding of what sexual assault is? I love that you want to do some work here to strengthen your sexual boundaries, and I urge a widespread conversation about what consent it.

If this is what your parents, siblings and extended family believe, it is possible that you have a broader view of yourself and haven't yet uncovered a way of defining your own philosophy of living.Give yourself the time to browse around online, or in person social meet ups, on your interests.

The other half of the time, I just want to walk away, but I feel like that will only be a temporary fix.", "answer": "You may be pressuring yourself to be the one person who fixes the relationship. This is impossible because the relationship belongs to both of you.Has he told you whether he feels about himself that how he interacts with you, is contributing to problems in the couple?Is he willing to understand what you're asking of him, without shutting down with whatever he is feeling when he feels blamed?Your feelings of distrust are the natural outcome of not being properly heard and understood. He's not willing to listen to you, so of course you're frustrated and this frustration comes out in all sorts of uneasy feelings.Willingness to hear each other in a non-defensive way, sometimes requires a couples therapist's assistance.Ask your husband if he's willing to understand, not judge you. Be willing yourself to do the same.If after trying and getting nowhere, you'll know when to stop trying on your own as a couple and to find a specifically trained couples therapists.Warning, not all therapists are trained to do couples therapy. Ask the therapist if they've had specialized training in couples therapy.Otherwise, having a referee type therapy session of, \"what do you think\", \"what do you think?\", isn't going to do anything except frustrate both of you further.Good luck!", "topic": "depression"}

I still love her the same way I did. I've suffered from depression ever since the breakup and have been unable to connect with anyone else. It's damaging me and my life.", "answer": "Hi Boise, I'm sorry that you've lost this love. The fact that you were planning marriage and a future tells me that you meant something very special to each other at that time. It's different now...you're not together anymore, but you can't accept this, right? Good for you for identifying that this situation is damaging your life. You've been grieving for longer than you were together. Oh, but really you've not been grieving...you're stuck still loving her instead of moving forward. Unrequited love is a recipe for eternal heartache. Let's look at some possible blocks to moving forward.It could be that there's something unfinished for you. Maybe you felt hurt and you didn't have the chance to say so, or you felt you hurt her and you didn't have the chance to make it right. Maybe there's a burning question you need to ask or something else you need to say. Maybe you want to tell her you've never stopped loving her, and see if she feels the same way. If this is the case, you have two choices, right? You can reach out and say what you need to say, or you can stop ruminating on that question and let it go. If you reach out, there's no guarantee it will go well or that she'll even respond. Maybe write her a letter and don't send it (or send it...it might be worth the risk). Use the next paragraph to help you decide. Do you know how she feels? How did it end? Did she end it? Was it ended just because of the distance, or are there more differences between you that didn't work? Sometimes people are so in love that they can't clearly see that the other person isn't in love with them anymore. Use the information you have about what she wants for her life...can you honour what she says she needs? If she's asked for distance, you would do well to honour that.A key to moving forward: look at your thoughts and where they're getting stuck. Write it down. What bad thing can happen if you let it go? Or \"If I move forward, that will mean...\" Keep going...what would be the worst part of that? This kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck place.It is possible that you've turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future. As in \"If this person doesn't love me, then I'm unlovable\", or \"No one will ever love me as much as she did\". So your need to cling to her in your heart is your way of rejecting that negative message about yourself or the future. Can you find another way to reject that message? Try saying these things to yourself:I know she loved me. There is evidence of that.I was a good partner. There is evidence of that.It's part of life to fall in love and then have to move forward...I can do this and learn from it.Many people like me...that's how I know I'm lovable.It's normal to feel sad. I'm grieving a lost love.I want to move forward and not stare in the rearview mirror.I know more love awaits me if I can get fear out of the way.If this person loved me, others can too, (but not if I'm clinging to some old memory)These are the kinds of things a therapist would explore with you.

I'm very depressed and angry. I feel lost.", "answer": "Hi Campbell River, You say you have anger but you don't mention how it shows. Or maybe it doesn't. Are you aggressive with your girlfriend? Since you mention depression, I wonder if you're bottling it all up somewhere instead of letting it show at all. If this is the case, I admire your ability to not lash out at someone who's hurting you. However, if they are totally unexpressed, anger turn inward and shift into depression. When she yells at you, what do you do? Is this the moment that you feel the most angry? I wouldn't be surprised; anger is a normal response to someone yelling at you. Something about anger...it's often there to cover up our more vulnerable emotions. Under the anger I wonder if you feel worthless, powerless, scared, unloved. Part of the trick to reducing anger is identifying those other emotions and expressing them. You say you don't know how to deal with life, and I think maybe you mean you don't know how to deal with emotions. Lots of people don't! This is confusing for most of us. What am I feeling? Why is it so strong? I'm afraid to express it for fear of hurting someone (or falling apart, or feeling alone...). How do I know what to express and what to be quiet about?

{"id": "counsel_00109", "question": "I've been having this ongoing problem for most of my life now. I am a young adult, and right now, driving and even being a passenger gives me terrible panic attacks and anxiety. I can't ride in the backseat or the front seat with the safety belt on. I have to lean the seat back a bit because the pressure on my back terrifies me. I miss so many opportunities to go places with friends and family because of my fears of having a panic attack. My family offers little to no support. They think it's fake or \"all in my head.\" It makes me feel guilty and at times depressed to the point where I'd rather never wake up anymore. I am not self-harming, I just feel meaningless. This constant fear has taken over my thoughts and my life. I was such a happy person. I want my life back. I want to travel with my friends and family again, but I don't know how. I've almost given up hope on getting better and just accepting the fact that I'll live with this anxiety forever.", "answer": "Not having support from your family for such a significant problem, is a problem itself.How about your friends, are any of them nurturing or treat you kindly when you bring up that you've got this problem?Are any of your friends willing to accommodate the fact that right now you've got panic attacks from driving and being a passenger?Maybe being and feeling accepted while you're in this current phase of your life, would help diminish the panic attacks.If no support is coming to you, then a next step would be to evaluate the relationships in your life and to develop standards and expectations of others, especially that they are considerate of your great need at this time.Its possible you are bearing the emotional burden of a lot more people in your life than yourself.If no one wants to show they care about this situation, then release yourself from trying to please and satisfy everyone's wish that you be better, while they ignore your need for their support.Be realistic in what you're able to give back to people who want to be blind to your emotional need.Thinking this way will at first raise your anxiety level from fear of losing everyone.

I don't enjoy the killing of the creature, but the hunt of it and to eat and drink the flesh and blood of the creature.", "answer": "I'm not sure that you don't feel emotion or that you are frightened of the depth of your emotions. From what you write, the context of your growing up years had people telling you to not feel. Little kids and babies don't remember whether or not they had emotions since birth. This is information someone told you or was part of your family system.Possibly your family was afraid of their emotions or of you knowing yours.Similarly, your comparison of being human means being monster like, is not an obvious connection. Besides, monsters are an idea, they aren't real. They embody what someone considers the worst qualities of themselves or the human species. Again, I wonder whether you've taken on stories you heard growing up about how unacceptable and bad you are.A way to start learning your emotions is to start in simple, basic ways to ask yourself what you are feeling in the situations that you believe emotions would belong.If on the first bright sunny and warm day of the year, you remind yourself to notice what you're feeling in response to this, you'll be taking one step toward awareness of your emotions.If someone buys you a birthday present, be aware of how you feel.

The person may feel resentful enough to not participate. And, sometimes the counselor is skillful enough to find a path to your daughter, or any patient's self-interest and engage them in therapy.Family counseling, regardless of your daughter's age, is another way to bring your concerns to your daughter's attention, in a therapy environment in which a counselor would be able to help distinguish the seriousness of your daughter's psychological problem, from simply a difference in viewpoints between you and your daughter, in how to handle certain situations.Also, if you believe your daughter is a threat to herself, then instead of this slower route, get in touch with the emergency psychological assessment service in your town, for a more immediate response.", "topic": "depression"}

While I can't give you advice on whether or not to continue medication, I would urge you to take an inventory of the positive and negative effects that you have noticed and educate yourself as much as possible about the short and long-term costs and benefits of psychiatric medication. If you can find a doctor, psychiatrist, or ARNP who is competent in mental health, it may also benefit you to consult with them.One thing that I am wondering about is, what is your support system like, in regards to your fight against depression? Are you seeing a therapist or attending any therapeutic or supportive group?

In regards to your coping behaviours at night, it sounds very isolating and also very silenced. As opposed to the sad music, why not try all music, allowing yourself to experience the wide breadth of emotions that are circling within you.

She curls up in corners at the mall and has panic attacks. She won't eat or drink in public. If she isn't having a panic attack or crying, she's clinging to me and avoiding everything and everyone. Her depression flares up out of nowhere and causes her to become very suicidal and self-harming. She get really sick from anxiety and scared to the point that I can't even get her to eat, drink, leave the bed, or go outside. She always tells me how she grew up around so much fighting and fear that it makes her scared of loud sounds, yelling, conflict, and even talking to strangers in public. She will refuse to go to a store unless I am with her to talk to the cashier for her. She is so scared that I can't even get her to drive. She doesn't want to get her license because she's scared of trying to drive. Some people have recommended medication, but I believe it's just going to cover up her illness and not solve it.

{"id": "counsel_00120", "question": "I am in high school and have been facing anxiety issues lately. Whenever I get close to being in a relationship, some kind of anxiety takes over and keeps me from the relationship. This anxiety causes me depression at times and even makes me want to vomit. While a semi-relationship should be joyous, for me, it’s an emotional nightmare I can’t get to the bottom of. I’ve had this before and had to leave the semi-relationship to avoid throwing up every time I made contact with my crush. What could be the reason behind this? Is it massive nerve problems? Is it a fear of a bad relationship? While I’m not quite ready to be in one anyway, I want to get to the bottom of this for a brighter future in which I can be in one. I don’t take medications and have no desire to, I have read forums, and I’ve talked about the issue with my sister who has faced similar problems.", "answer": "Hi Helena,I felt a bit sad when I read this. This is a new term for me... \"semi-relationship\". What does it mean? I know that today's culture for young people is more of a \"hook-up\" culture than a dating one. Maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore. That makes me feel sad. I hear a lot of young women (I'm not sure you're female, but that's my guess) say that they struggle with hook-ups because they can't let themselves hope for a phone call after a hook-up. Research tells us that, after a hook-up, college age women tend to feel used and unworthy, and men tend to feel guilty. I think this scenario works better for men than women, but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the end.This is only one possible explanation for your anxiety...that your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether it's okay to want or expect that.Maybe take a moment and listen to anxiety. Anxiety tends to try to convince us that something's wrong with us or something bad's going to happen. Anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague (it's more difficult to refute it then), but you can try to clarify it's whisperings by asking yourself these questions: What am I afraid of? What is the worst thing that might happen here? Then what might happen, and what would be the worst part of that? Keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen? Might someone not want you...might you feel rejected...or feel not good enough...you might get hurt?Then when you find that core fear, you can look at your life and I bet you'd find a place where that idea or fear originated. A big moment (or many smaller ones) when you actually DID feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt. In the end, it's a feeling you're trying to avoid (not life or relationship), and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious. But this doesn't work for you! Good! With the help of a qualified therapist, you can learn to talk back to anxiety and move forward in life and love with calm. confidence.", "topic": "depression"}

He was talking to other women and lying about it. It pushed me away and hurt me, but I'm still in love with him. A couple days after our breakup, he was talking to someone new. He told me he wasn't sure if he loved me. I cried for several days, lost my appetite, and couldn't sleep. Our whole relationship was only us. We didn't have friends. It was me and him against the world. We didn't talk to anyone else because we only wanted to talk to each other. We hung out constantly and Skyped to sleep every single night. Then, when I cut myself, we talked on Skype. He cried and told me \"I'm still in love with you, I never stopped loving you,\" and I cried tears of joy. I asked multiple times if he loved me and asked to make sure he wasn't just saying that because of me being so depressed. He promised and assured me he loved me. He came over after that, and we had sex because he wanted to. He went the home that night and told me he didn't love me, and he lied because he was scared.

Losing the most significant person in your life is extremely painful and breakups are often equated to a death. There will certainly be a grieving process that you go through and time passing will allow the hurt to subside. With that being said, seeing a therapist is highly recommended as it sounds like continuous support may be necessary for healing to take place. Anytime sadness causes thoughts of suicide or self harm, it is important to get help immediately. A therapist can help you by validating your feelings and what you are going through, while also working with you to move through the grieving process, adopt new hobbies, social outlets, and goals for your future. While starting over and trying out new ways of being may seem like a daunting task, it will only make things easier and give you a sense of hope and purpose for your future. With the new year right around the corner, this could be viewed as a good time and opportunity to get reaquainted with yourself and set goals related to living a more fullfilling life. Hang in there. With a support system in place and a healthy mindset, things can only get easier. Best of luck to you!", "topic": "depression"}

Questioning mainstream thinking and being in touch with your own views, are signs of strength and clarity in a person.As a therapist, I always tell my patients to avoid anti-depressants.Their effectiveness is in suppressing a person's mood and feelings. If someone does not know how they are feeling, then they will have more difficulty in understanding themselves, their uncertainties and hesitations, and overall, how they relate to others and what they expect from others.Anti-depressants mask how someone feels.In a crisis, temporarily taking anti-depressants may be helpful. If someone is so overwhelmed that they are not functioning, then suppressing unhappy feelings so that the person can get through a day, may be of benefit for a short while.Basically, respect and follow your own opinion about anti-depressants. Your view is shared by many. It is a minority opinion, and very valid. If you would like to shop for a therapist, ask the person on the phone, what their opinions are about anti-depressants.Ideally, you will eventually find a therapist who thinks in a way which is similar to you, or at least similar enough that you will have a sense that you are able to trust working with them on whatever you define as problematic.I hope you will have an easy and productive therapist search!", "topic": "depression"}

The theory basically states that you can not control an event but you can control your reaction to the emotions associated with said event. For instance here is an example:A (Action or Event): You need to talk to someone and that person is not calling you back.B (Behavior or Response): You begin to tell yourself that this person is too busy for me or I am not important to this person.C (Consequence): You feel depressed.If you look at the model, B has a direct effect on C. The thought is if you change your reaction to A, then C will have a better consequence, such as:A: stays the same.B (this is what you change): This person must be busy, they will call me back when they get a chance or I can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is available.C: Decreased feelings of depression & overall functioning improves.This is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that effect your behavior, studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve. If this model resonates with you, I recommend \"Feeling better, getting better, staying better\" by Alber Ellis.

{"id": "counsel_00133", "question": "I've have lived for sometime with depression but things have gotten a lot better, but why is it so hard to get over anxiety and social isolation?", "answer": "The best way to handle depression and anxiety is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor, and therapy to help you understand the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are causing the depression and anxiety in the first place and then to replace these with more positive thoughts and behaviors. This is not something that anyone should just “white knuckle” and try to get through on their own with no help. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety. This takes a therapist trained in CBT. There are some things in life that you cannot change and must learn to accept. A lot of people spend time trying to change things that they have no control over. This may be the behavior of someone else in your life or it could be a situation that you cannot change, such as the recent death of a loved one, a lost relationship, or an accident or illness which has left you handicapped. In cases like this, what can change is your attitude and thoughts about the situation that you now find yourself in. One thing that is inevitable about life is that stuff happens and it is not always pleasant. Some people take these unpleasant occurrences very hard and it throws them into a deep depression. Other people seem to be able to handle life’s ups and downs and bounce back. They do this with having positive coping skills in their life. Learning new coping skills is something your therapist can help you with.A lot of people are so focused on trying to change the things in their life that they cannot change and are ignoring the things that they can change. There are things that you can do. Here is a quote for you to consider. “You are getting almost everything that you are getting based on the choices that you have made. You will continue to get the same thing out of life until you make some changes.” Another quote I like is “You will find a way or you will find an excuse.” Don’t ever say that you have no choice. Everyone has a choice. You might not particularly like any of the choices that you are facing, but you do have choices. Not happy in a relationship? You can leave it. Hate your job? Get a new one. If it matters to you, you will find a way. Don’t sit there complaining about everything but not doing anything different or better.Take care of yourself. Exercise is very important not only for your physical health, but for your mental health as well. Eating right and exercising will help you feel better about yourself. Also, find a meditation that works for you. There are progressive muscle relaxation exercises, visual and mental meditations, and many many more.

The second time really got to me and at my lowest I hurt him back. We aren't communicating as well as I would like. What do I do?", "answer": "Hi there. Thank you reaching out for help. It takes a lot of courage for someone that is being abused to reach out for help. I want you to know that I am here to help you in any way that I can. First and foremost, you did not mention whether or not you had children yourself by this man. I’m going to assume there are. So, the most important thing right at this moment is asking yourself, if you and your children are safe? Is the boyfriend currently living in the home or is he coming and going? If he is coming and going or currently living in the home, my suggestion for you to is to pack a bag for you and your children and go somewhere safe (i.e. family members home, friend or a shelter temporarily). I cannot stress this enough. Although, some people tend to minimize their abusers behavior (i.e. they only do it when they are drinking, they only do it when they are mad), it’s those individuals that find themselves or their children in a serious situation. So, you can never take abuse (physical or mental) lightly because you never know what is going through that persons mind at that particular time. It’s always better to be safe than sorry. Secondly, it will not be safe, helpful or productive to attempt to talk to the abuser about your relationship. Abusers often times try and manipulate you into staying by apologizing or attempting to justify their behaviors. This is the time you would want to go see a magistrate in order to get a protective order for you and your children.It’s unfortunate that your significant other was involved with another women causing pregnancy; however, that is no longer your concern. Your concern at this point is keeping yourself and your children safe. I would also suggest counseling for you and your children in order to work through these issues.

I don't think these thoughts are normal.", "answer": "You might be surprised how normal you are. Anxiety is incredibly common and while your particular type of existential anxiety might be unique to you - it is very difficult for most people to really comprehend what happens after we die - regardless of the religious or philosophical belief systems we hold. It is the ultimate unknown and some philosophers and psychologists believe that at the root of our day-to-day anxieties is the fear of death or fear of the unknown. Just as it can be really hard to comprehend the ending of life it can also be hard to comprehend an eternal existence. What these both have in common is that we are imaging a future that is ultimately unknowable and this unknown can provoke a lot of anxiety. Mindfulness based practices like meditation - maybe there is something like this in your religious tradition - can be very helpful in making peace with the unknown in the present moment. The more we can learn to live in the moment - the less we get hung up on anticipating outcomes for our lives that may never come true. Mindfulness practices can help you ground, be where you are , relax and regulate your nervous system so that you are able sleep and recuperate, and train your attention to focus on living the life you want to live now - rather than worrying about what happens after you die. Having said all that - it can be profoundly helpful to speak with someone about your anxiety - especially when you feel haunted by it, worry that you are crazy and can't get to sleep.

What can I do to try and control it?", "answer": "I'm going to reframe this and you can decide if this is helpful!What I'm reading based on what you gave is that you are actually doing your best to manage intense feelings of internal dysregulation. Anger is something that is generally a protective emotion that quickly arises to keep us safe in some way, whether or not the situation is truly a threat. The part of our brain that perceives this is not controllable to us, so we don't get to decide what emotion(s) we respond with.It does also sound like you are experiencing some significant anxiety, maybe even underlying the anger? Without knowing the context, it's hard to say what would help on an individual level but working through those triggers and what is really influencing them deep down could be beneficial. There's many different ways to do that in therapy if you so choose that as your path.If you do decide to see a therapist, most will tell you that the goal is not necessarily to control your anxiety or anger. Sometimes there's a strong set of beliefs that, when activated, are catalysts to strong emotions that influence behavior. Trying to control an emotion on its own is usually unsuccessful for people because it leaves out all the other powerful elements at play. Emotions are information and the brain sends that information out because it believes we need it at that time. Therapists can help unravel that with you in whatever way you need, whether that's with somatic work, work at the level of belief (or schemas), or otherwise---hitting it at these deeper layers can unpair and/or decrease emotional responses. It all takes work and time, so don't get down on yourself if the process is complicated or slower than you expected or hoped for.What we know though is that the brain is very capable of change (even if it's painful).

It may not be that the end-all-be-all answer is to be cared for, but the absence of care (or even self-care) can seem like we are only existing for others. Sometimes having someone to rely on can help take off some of the edge--the pressure--of all that is overwhelming.Despite that, it may be that the situation continues to be exactly what it is, providing a steady stream of stress for you (which would be so difficult). I don't think anyone can tell you what to do because no one here has to live with those consequences, good or bad. Just a note that sometimes with men it is harder to reach out for help. Perhaps he feels comfortable enough for you to know he's struggling (which means you have provided him a safe space to do just that) but not comfortable enough to interact with a stranger about those same struggles. Men often avoid therapy because it's seen as weak and/or means you need help. Planting seeds here is sometimes all you can do, as hard as that is.As far as supporting goes, there's much more you can do there if he is ready to receive that. If you are seeing him in the midst of panic, the best thing you can do is let him know you are there for him. Maybe that means being there physically, or continuing to give him encouragement along the way (e.g., \"You got this\", \"I know this is hard\", etc.). If you aren't present for the attacks but he's telling you about them, you can ask what you can provide for him in those moments or how you can help him afterward. Panic attacks can be taxing on the body so sometimes people need time to recover. Remember that you also need to recover here, too. It's very painful to watch someone you love panic. What might you need there?Of course, counseling can be a great place to work through that stress and overwhelm. That time is all for you to be heard and understood.

{"id": "counsel_00143", "question": "I have a fear of something and I want to face that fear to overcome it, but I don't know how. What can I do?", "answer": "Fears are not that difficult to deal with, first you need to train yourself to relax using some relaxation strategy, once you are able to employ that in your daily life, you then need to start facing your fear, for instance I'll use an example of a man who has a fear of driving over a bridge. We would build a hierarchy of fears, that is a list of fears ranging from least to most, for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique, then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique, then moving closer to the bridge, then maybe standing on a bridge, all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing, until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge, or you can also engage in flooding which is for example, if you were scared of an elevator, go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore, in the movie Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne who has a great fear of bats, goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them. Secondly, look at your fears, do they even need to be worked on, some fears are healthy, for example if i was a therapist in New York City and someone came to me and said \"I'm scared of snakes\", I would probably say that is OK because there are very little snakes left in ManhattanHope that helps C", "topic": "anxiety"}

It is very unnerving when thoughts control your life. One way to combat them is to figure out whose voice the words are said in. Oftentimes people say things to us and it stays with us, and it is not often true. We let others’ opinions penetrate our brains and live rent-free in our heads. You could try to rewrite the thoughts, the negative thoughts, rewrite them in a positive way. For example “you are not worth anything” you could rewrite that in a way that shows all the ways you are worthy. Write all your accomplishments, and things you have overcome and proof that you are in fact worthy because you are! You can Interrupt the thought, focus, redirect elsewhere. If you are replaying a specific moment you could go back into that moment and retell the moment, rewrite the moment so that it is what you would rather it have been.

So how is the stress affecting you?Is it serious enough to stop you from presenting or is it just \"butterflies\"?There are many ways of dealing with the anxiety and stress. Much depends on how serious the stress is.So here are a few ideas:1. Practice in front of a mirror.Sounds strange but the practice helps.2. Ask some friends to listen to your presentations. Not so much for their input as to just get used to presenting.3. Focus on the material you are presenting. The subject matter is what you want to get across. Step away from your nerves and get into the facts you want to present. Let the material you present be the focus. 4. Remember everyone else is just as nervous as you. Share your fears with some of your classmates and gain support from them. Focus on a friendly face during the presentation. Be a support to them in return.5. \"Fake it, till you make it\". Yes it sounds blunt. But sometimes that's what it takes. Even if you feel like it, you won't die.So much more can be discussed with a competent counselor.

How can I get over this feeling?", "answer": "It sounds like you are on the right track. Recognizing these nagging thoughts of self- doubt as \"imposter syndrome\" is a huge step in the right direction. From what you have written here, it appears that you are able to challenge your own thoughts and provide yourself with evidence that counteracts the imposter syndrome.

I also was dealing with an abusive relationship (mentally, physically, and emotionally). Now I live like a recluse and I always feel nervous around people. How can I feel more comfortable around other people?", "answer": "There's a lot of layers there to your situation, and I'm focusing on two layers that may be contributing to your feelings of discomfort around others. One layer is the daunting news that your son has autism. Many parents can feel overwhelmed and distraught with this diagnosis. The vast array of treatments available is daunting in and of itself at times to wrap one's head around. Taking time to reflect or seek out therapy regarding how this diagnosis has impacted you may be helpful. Some parents feel their individual identity gets lost in the diagnosis because they have dropped everything to help their child, and others may experience guilt. If either of these or other feelings come to the forefront for you, it may be worth working through them with a therapist. A support group list is available through www.autismspeaks.org and may help connect you with others raising children with autism.A second layer is the abusive relationship you were involved in. The trauma you experienced in this relationship may have a very meaningful impact on your ability to trust and to be intimate with others. Engaging with a therapist can help facilitate the healing process, as well as paving the way for more comfortable and trusting relationships.", "topic": "anxiety"}

I can understand your not liking or enjoying being around other people. Animals are often more compassionate. It sounds like you experience a lot of social anxiety?

I believe I have separation anxiety. Is there anything that I can do to help me cope with this while he is out of town?", "answer": "Relationships at any amount of distance can be so hard! It makes sense that you are encountering more anxiety than usual given that major change in your relationship. And you're right that being separated from our partners can heighten our insecurities and worries about not only our relationship security but about our partner's interest. Have you talked with your boyfriend about this struggle you're feeling? It can be hard to have this kind of conversation without triggering a sense of blame and subsequent defensiveness in our partners, but it really is possible. If you have any concerns about being able to do this, then a session or two with a local counselor or therapist might be really helpful - and it really can be just about finding the way to share what you're feeling.As far as coping with anxiety, there are a lot of options but I highly recommend an app called Self-Help for Anxiety Management.

I’m paranoid about driving on main roads. I’m very jumpy at the slightest noises.", "answer": "Given the description you have posted here, it may be time to find someone to work with. First and foremost, look into working with someone who specializes in working with individuals with challenges surrounding drinking. This would need to be assessed first since if it has been ongoing, it may be making the situation worse and given the time it has been utilized as a coping mechanism, there is reason to believe that the structure of your brain may have been effected as has been demonstrated by current neurological research. There are however, ways to address this. As for coping mechanisms, the person you work with should also look at offering you alternatives such as the skills found within the Dialectic Behavior Therapy model (DBT) which has several useful tools to help address the underlying anxiety and difficulty managing emotional regulation. Mindfulness, another component of DBT should also prove to be useful in both becoming aware of your state of mind and emotional state to allow you to make different choices which has been supported by a growing body of evidence. There are also other tools designed to help repair damaged relationships. Well worth looking into.Seeking help is never easy and it is only human to be hesitant given some of the cultural views of working with therapist. This is a difficult place to be in and one that is not easy to move out of, but sitting on it is not going to help it go away.

However, I also want to add a few points. It seems as though you are at a point where you want to speak to someone. Honestly, you might not find the correct therapist for you right away. It can be difficult to find someone who fits with you, who helps you feel comfortable and speaks to you completely unbiased and without judgement. That being said, those kinds of therapists do exist. Many therapists offer free consultations, perhaps not the first session like Laura, but a phone call where you can speak with them. That can give you a good idea of what they are like and if you \"fit\" with them.Alternatively, have you considered going to a group? This can take a lot of pressure off of you, because there are a lot of grief groups and many are for those who lost loved ones to drug use. These can be something you do weekly, bi-weekly or even monthly and could be a stepping stone for you to get to the point where you feel ready to see an individual therapist.

Here are some basic tips to handle those stressors.· Learn thought stopping techniques: There are multiple ways to teach your brain to refocus. If you allow your brain to focus on the source of anxiety, the anxiety will be in charge. But you can learn to put those anxiety-provoking thoughts on a parking lot, and focus on pleasurable thoughts, or the activity that you need to complete on the time being.· Plan, organize, delegate: Create a schedule to manage demands, organize priorities, and delegate or share responsibilities. Work as a team with your family, so you can share the load. Prioritize actives, shores, and expenses. Focus on the urgent, necessary, and spread apart the not so urgent.· Identify triggers: Once you understand what causes your anxiety, you can learn to channel process and refocus your thoughts. You can also learn coping strategies to manage the problem or give up the desire to control it if needed.· Learn coping skills: Having a balanced lifestyle helps tremendously to reduce and manage anxiety symptoms. Looking at your eating, sleeping, physical activities, spirituality and leisure time is key to find that balance.If you find yourself struggling with anxiety, you can contact a Counselor or mental health provider.

Aquí unos consejos básicos para manejar esas preocupaciones.· Aprende como detener tus pensamientos: Hay múltiples maneras de enseñarle a tu cerebro a reenfocarse. Si permites que tu cerebro se enfoque en la fuente de ansiedad, entonces la ansiedad se apoderará de ti. Pero puedes aprender a poner a un lado esos pensamientos que causan ansiedad, y enfocarte en pensamientos positivos, placenteros o simplemente enfocarte en la actividad que estás haciendo. · Planifica, organiza, delega: Crea una agenda para manejar las demandas diarias, organizar prioridades y delegar o compartir responsabilidades. Trabaja en equipo con tu familia, de manera que puedas compartir la carga. Organiza las actividades, gastos y tareas por prioridad. Enfócate en lo urgente y necesario y distribuye lo que no es tan vital. · Identifica la fuente: Ya que comprendes donde o qué inicia la ansiedad, puedes aprender a canalizarla, procesarla o reenfocar tus pensamientos. También puedes aprender a manejar la fuente de ansiedad, resolver el problema, o aceptar que no lo puedes controlar, si ese fuera el caso. · Aprende mecanismos de defensa: Tener un estilo de vida balanceado ayuda tremendamente a manejar síntomas de ansiedad.

There are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression that there may be others with lesser side effects.But beyond that, have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing or meditation? Meditation can be very effective, but it takes practice and you don't have to sit cross-legged for hours chanting \"Ohm\" to meditate. It's about focusing on your breath, rather than all the thoughts that are racing through your head. And when they do take your mind off your breath, simply refocus (and refocus and refocus). Like I said, it takes practice, so don't give up. You can find many sites offering different ways to meditate, so look around and see what works best for you.

Where do you think that anxiety comes from? I would try some self-reflecting to see what comes up there. Maybe you are worried about losing your best friend, or something completely different. It's understandable that you would have a lot of feelings in this situation, especially since this person is very close to you. The dealing with it part is probably going to be pretty tough. You are processing through circumstances that you probably can't talk to him, your best friend, about. Do you have anyone else you can talk through it with? Maybe another good friend or someone that knows the situation? When we're most in need sometimes we become more aware of who around us can be of help. A counselor can help here, too if that's an option you are considering or have access to.If he does start leaning on you to talk about his crush, there may be some boundaries that you could consider putting up. That may mean distancing from him a bit, or telling him how you feel. That part is all up to what you feel most right doing and what works best for your friendship.

All I have to do is talk the popular people. They're really nice to me, but I'm too scared of change. I really want to work up the courage to lose my fear.", "answer": "Talking to people can be pretty scary. When we talk to people, sometimes we overanalyze what we say or how we react in fear that we will seem weird or they won't like us, which makes us appear awkward. So that overthinking piece can ironically work against us.When you talk to them, really spend time to listen to what they are saying. Your default may be to think about how you will respond or what's cool to say, but people like it best (usually) when you are genuine and yourself. If you focus on what you are paying attention to (them), then you will naturally have a response. If you can overthink about yourself, you can definitely have some thoughts pop up when talking to other people!Also keep in mind that if the conversations turn out to be less than you'd hoped for, that's OK. I'm assuming you are in high school, but in any situation with peers, if they don't like you then they aren't worth all your worry and effort.

I can't image how this must feel, but I can assure you that you are not alone. These are common experiences in our society where we are made to feel as though we must \"go go go\".

I believe that starting with \"baby steps\" such as taking even 10-20 minutes for yourself daily to be in the quiet and reflect can be helpful.

I'm assuming you are often tired and don't sleep as well as you could, especially as our thoughts tend to creep up on us when we are trying to fall asleep.One thing to know is that those thought patterns are a protective mechanism. Ruminating on what could happen and how we will respond is how we feel prepared for what's to come. In a logical sense, there's so much uncertainty in life that trying to plan all that out is nearly impossible. Although not a bad idea to have a game plan or rehearse how you are going to respond to conflict, endlessly revisiting those things tend to take away from why we want to be prepared in the first place--to protect our well-being (in any aspect). The trick is how to calm the brain which is so much easier said than done! To start, take the time to write your thoughts down. You can do that via journaling, or by splitting a piece of paper into two categories (one side is helpful planning and other side unhelpful planning). The brain is a spectacular organ, but sometimes we really need to see things externally to be able to process them effectively. Excessive worry is really a result of pretty significant fears--whether those fears come from not feeling like you can handle situations, that other people can't handle things, that you will lose something important to you, or that you will fail. Writing about those fears could help you understand where those thoughts are coming from, or you could even talk those out with a friend or counselor. Sometimes someone else's feedback about our situations can change how we see things since we tend to get perpetually stuck in the same perspectives.My last suggestion is to work on trying to stay in the present via mindfulness, at least 5 minutes a day. It's probably going to feel foreign and weird, maybe even scary, since you live more in the future vs the present moment. It's common for the brain to respond by trying to push back into those thinking patterns, but mindfulness actually increases your ability to problem-solve and see things more clearly. Constant anxiety clouds us. Mindfulness clears that out. And I'm sure you really could use a brain break!", "topic": "anxiety"}
{"id": "counsel_00165", "question": "I have a panic attack at least once a week and suffer from severe anxiety.", "answer": "I'm sorry you're going through that. Panic attacks are terrifying.One thing to start with is knowing that panic attacks are not going to hurt you and your anxiety will come down with time. Fighting that process can sometimes heighten symptoms because your brain wants the message of panic to be heard. Some of the best ways to counter that message is through focusing on the present moment through sensations or breathing. Taking deep breaths allows your body and brain to slow down, sending the message that there's no present danger. Focusing on the present can also send the same message, as anxiety typically throws us into the \"what ifs\" of the future. If you search google or pinterest, there are tons of methods you can use for this---some people prefer to focus on colors, shapes, smells, textures, etc., while other prefer to pay attention to internal sensations. There are also apps that can help with these techniques, such as Calm and Headspace. They work best when you aren't in a panic attack or when you feel one coming on. If you are already at the peak of an attack, they can still help, it just may take a bit longer. Some clients I have like to track their anxiety with a scale system. Let's say you scale your anxiety at an 8 out of 10, do some breathing exercises for 5 minutes, then scale it again. It's likely the anxiety decreased, at least to a 7 or 7.5. Doing this can give you some physical proof that you have some control over your body. You can also scale it without the breathing to see how it just fluctuates on its own. Anxiety will always go down and you can see that happening via numbers. This method will let you see the light at the end of the tunnel.There are other ways that might work for you via a quick google search, or through therapy. Keep trying new things until you find what works best for you!", "topic": "anxiety"}
{"id": "counsel_00166", "question": "I was in a car accident and totaled my car. I gave up my job of nine years to pursue school full-time to better myself. I failed a class, and my boyfriend that I live with thinks I’m stupid and wants to break up with me. I have nowhere to go, and I feel like I’m losing everything.", "answer": "Doesn't sound like your boyfriend is a source of support and I'm really sorry to hear that. And my assumption is that the car accident was traumatic for you and still impacts you in some ways.By just reading what you wrote, I'm not sure what that impact has been on you, but I get the impression that maybe you are now carless and have no reliable method of transportation to get to school or other places you need to go. Maybe you are also scared to be in a vehicle? My first thought after reading this is that I wouldn't be thrilled about getting into a car if mine was totaled in an accident. It may even incite terror. None of that is your fault--it's an expected response to a horrible situation.My second thought was that you are obviously very committed and reliable if you had a job of nine years. Not to mention brave for stepping out of the comfort of a job to pursue school full-time. That's a giant transition that you should get so much credit for, from yourself and from the people closest to you. Failing doesn't mean you made the wrong decision. I've failed classes as well when I was just starting out in college. It truly doesn't mean anything about you--it just means that things got in the way and you can either try again, or learn something about yourself (or both) and what you want out of an academic career. The feelings around failing may feel raw at the moment, but readdress them in a couple weeks or a month and notice how your perspective may change, as well as the steps you may take despite the situation. Be careful of how much your boyfriend is contributing to how you feel about yourself, too. I'm guessing you already felt pretty terrible, then his words or actions rubbed it in. Who do you have in your life that is compassionate toward you? If you aren't sure, seeking out a counselor can be really great with all the emotions of a big transition like you are going through. In the meantime, focus on the things you have total control over--your breath, little choices that you make throughout the day, etc. Mindfulness and meditation can be a way for you to get some peace and slow down from the chaos of your life and thoughts.", "topic": "anxiety"}
{"id": "counsel_00167", "question": "I have been thinking a lot about certain situations and having my worries about what others may think or say.", "answer": "I think it's a great idea that you are asking this question now while it's early on. The first thing I wonder is what age you are. At different transitions and stages in life, it's really common for anxieties to come out of the woodwork. First time this takes place at a greater level is during adolescence, because a teen's \"job\" is to figure out who they are within the context of other people. Spikes in anxiety also can also occur after high school when you are leaving the nest and heading to college, or the late twenties when it feels like you are expected to have your life figured out and compare to where others are in their lives. That same scenario can show up in mid-life as well for different reasons depending on the person. Aside from age, certain circumstances can influence a jump in anxiety, such as a job change, switching schools, moving, opening a business, college finals, etc. Take some time to explore where the anxiety might be coming from and just see what comes up. It may be something you have some control over, or something that you can ask for help from someone else for--especially if it's social anxiety. The more you practice social skills, the more confidence you'll have in the long-run.A metaphor I use with some people is gas for a car. Anxiety is a necessary motivator for action, though you get to decide where to go with that anxiety. An overfilled tank doesn't get you any further than a normally-filled tank, and more gas doesn't mean the gas is in charge of where you go. Applying that to what I know about your situation--how much of that worrying is getting you somewhere, how much is just extra gas, and are the worries changing what you really want to do? Sometimes knowing the makeup of our anxiety gives us more power over how we deal with it, and I think you could for sure get there with some help.", "topic": "anxiety"}
{"id": "counsel_00168", "question": "I have a fear of talking with people. I don't like to go out to social events. I'm always worrying about someone judging me.", "answer": "Thanks for reaching out and asking this question. Social stuff is hard. Even for people that don't have diagnosed social anxiety. Some research outlines that our fear of public speaking is greater than our fear of death. That's hefty! Shame is often the culprit for social anxiety because we think other people will see the flaws in ourselves that we believe are there. I've had experiences where I thought the person thought something awful of me, just to find out it was exactly the opposite. That's how powerful our minds can be!What are other things that people may think of you? Maybe you are very kind and easy to talk to. Maybe you think differently than other people and some people enjoy hearing your perspectives. It's even a possibility that they are worrying about the same things as you, even if they seem very confident. Confidence can be easy to fake if it's how you cope with fear.To work through some of that, it's much better to force yourself out there and have conversations. Avoiding people sends the message to your brain that not only are those situations dangerous (socially), but that you can't handle them. The more you avoid, the harder it gets and the more anxiety is created by just the thought of being around people. Take it moment by moment, too. Thinking about all the conversations you are confronted with in a day is overwhelming. Just focus on getting through each conversation, and give yourself credit for doing that---even if you felt awkward, embarrassed, etc. Social skills can be taught at any stage of life, and there's always room for mistakes. No one in society communicates perfectly and you don't need to put that pressure on yourself.The last thing I'd say is keep at least 1-3 people in your life that feel really good to talk to--like it's not a task. Talking to acquaintances and random people is not to fulfill a need for close connection (unless you end up finding a great friend), but more to feel like you are definitely able to handle conversations without the threat of crippling anxiety. You may even get to a place where you enjoy it (sometimes). Reach out to people in your life if you need extra support!", "topic": "anxiety"}
{"id": "counsel_00169", "question": "I have a bad habit of thinking and worrying about what others may think of me. I really want to stop it and enjoy things.", "answer": "We all experience that to a different level, depending on who you ask. It's actually born out of a good quality---prosocialness. When we care what others think of us, we are also attuned to how we are treating them and what's socially right vs wrong. It definitely does feel like it's more about ourselves, however--meaning it feels like we worry about what others think because we don't want to be socially outcast or rejected. That's also (again, to a certain level) a healthy quality. It means you want connection. Connection is crucial to mental health and, according to some available research, physical health. No matter how mentally healthy or socially confident you are, if you care about connection, you're going to care about what people think of you to an extent. So the work here is to figure out what worry is warranted vs what is just causing you suffering. A good way to tell the difference here is to write it out in list form. Write out all the socially-anxious thoughts you have and scale them from \"needed\" or \"helpful\" to \"unnecessary\" or \"unhelpful\". Some may fall in the gray area here. For example: if you worry that others think you are inconsiderate, so you often say sorry---weed out what's actually inconsiderate vs what you feel is maybe inconsiderate because you feel like a burden to others. Getting in someone's personal space would warrant some worry and an apology. Asking for help when you need it is something you don't have to apologize for. Something else to consider here is there's probably some underlying shame. Shame is a cluster of really tough feelings and if it had a voice, it'd say things like, \"you're not good enough\", \"you aren't likeable\", \"you are annoying and no one wants to be around you\", etc. Those feelings typically create the worry you experience about others. Shame survives and is strengthened by the attention you give to it. The more you compete with it, the less powerful it becomes. Sometimes that comes in the form of noticing the wonderful qualities in yourself. Sometimes it takes practice putting yourself out there when it's really scary. No matter what, shame's nemesis is connection---to yourself and to others. That's how you prove it's wrong. Try not to take shame at face value!If you are struggling with using these techniques or just don't know if they are right for you, a counselor can help you out and give you a more individualized approach. Sometimes it's just figuring out that specific formula that works for you that makes all the difference. And of course, counseling is built on a strong connection.I wish you all the best!", "topic": "anxiety"}
{"id": "counsel_00170", "question": "I have been repeating the same thought pattern for seven years and have completely lost control of any situation. I am in my early 30s, and I feel like I am trapped in my body, mind, soul, and house because I feel embarrassed to go anywhere or talk to anyone.", "answer": "There's SO much help for repetitive thoughts in the counseling world! The one thing I'd for sure ask if we met in person is what those repetitive thought patterns look like. Some repetitive thoughts are more like obsessive thoughts. For example, that may mean that every time you leave a room, your obsessive thought is to switch the light on and off 5 times. Or every time you touch a door handle, you think about the germs you came into contact with and washing your hands multiple times. Sometimes it's more about the same thoughts repeating about bad things that may happen, or critical thoughts we have about ourselves. Your statement about \"feeling confident again\" gives me the sense that maybe you struggle with the ways in which you think about yourself.Assuming it's obsessive thoughts: exposure and response prevention therapy is an excellent form of treatment. Typically, obsessive thoughts influence compulsions, which usually show up as very strict, repetitive rituals in order to manage anxiety. Exposure and response prevention exposes you to the things that increase anxiety, while response prevention helps you to sit through that anxiety response without performing a compulsion. For example, you touch a door handle. Your anxiety increases. You obsess about the germs you came into contact with and have a strong urge to wash your hands multiple times. Instead, you sit through the anxiety, let the anxiety decrease on its own, and slowly unpair that anxious response with the behavior. The more you do this, the more it breaks up those thinking/behavior patterns that make you feel chained to them.Assuming it's self-critical thoughts: cognitive-behavioral therapy can work well here. Everyone's brain has a default track, that when met with struggle, plays over and over like a broken record. The more you give into that, the more it plays. The trick here is creating a competing track, or turning the volume up on a track that boosts your confidence instead of shooting it down. Some ways to do that are really identifying and writing down what those repetitive thoughts are. You probably already know them pretty well if they repeat often. Then next to them--write out a line that has an heir of confidence and/or gentleness. For example, if your repetitive thought is that you are a failure, you may write out a sentence that is something like: I may be struggling greatly with this situation, yet I am still trying super hard to get better and that's definitely not a failure. Every separate repetitive thought can have its own competing sentence. Initially, these new thoughts will feel weird, foreign, and maybe even like they don't do anything. Give it time. The repetitive thoughts have had years to grow, so these new thoughts need time, too. They are, literally, new pathways in the brain and the more they are traveled, the stronger they will get.I'm also sensing that there's a combination of anxiety and depression. I would assume that you are probably feeling pretty cut off from the world if you don't want to talk to anyone. That can be so lonely and isolating. Because connection is basically crucial for healing, it may be very beneficial for you to see a counselor or find a support that feels safe to you. Counselors are usually trained very well in these types of issues and some offer telehealth if you are having trouble leaving your home. It might feel scary and strange at first, but you are in a lot of pain and deserve healing.Hope this helps a bit. Go with your gut and do what you feel is right for you!

I feel obligated to do track because I'm not a horrible runner, and my dad wants me to. The catch is is that the days before a track meet and the morning of, I get sick and cry.", "answer": "Seems like you have some confidence in your track abilities, but feel pressured by your dad to continue something you don't really enjoy. Are you maybe worried about disappointing your dad, or is it something about track itself that upsets you or overwhelms your body?When we try to push through stuff that's too much for our bodies (whether that's physical or emotional), that stress will show up no matter how hard we try to bury it. Sometimes that shows up as crying or irritation, other times that shows up as physical symptoms. For you, it could be both. Based on the symptoms showing up days before a meet, it could be more emotional since it comes so long beforehand. I'm assuming you are very active already, so extra exercise probably isn't too helpful and may only put more stress on your body. Do you feel like you ever get a chance to truly relax? Always running on overdrive with little gas is exhausting. Try giving yourself permission during the period before the track meets to just do something that slows you down. Doesn't have to be super long--even 10-15 minutes a day could give your brain and body a very needed break from that go-go-go lifestyle.Pay attention to your sleep as well. I don't know anything about your nightly routine, but if you are struggling to sleep that could enhance the symptoms of anxiety before your meets. Some calm activities before bed could help here.Of course, you could try talking with your dad about whats happening if you think he'd be able to support your needs. That's not always possible, and if not, no worries. There's a lot you can do to get through what's happening. If you have another caregiver in the picture that feels approachable, you could talk to him/her about how you are feeling. Also, take a look at strategies for performance anxiety online. Even if you don't have that particular type of anxiety, the strategies are really great and can at least help a little if you are still engaging in track.", "topic": "anxiety"}

As a teen, you're developing your identity based on what feels right to you and what doesn't. It's OK to be different than your friends, and just being around swearing doesn't mean you will for sure pick up that habit. What is it that connects your anxiety to swearing? If it feels like your automatic response might be to curse, you could try picking some words that don't go against your values to use as a default when you are upset.

Breathing exercises as well as thought replacement (replacing an unhelpful thought with a helpful one) are good for that. Whatever you try, I wish you the best of luck!", "topic": "anxiety"}

{"id": "counsel_00174", "question": "It's especially bad at night time. I am scared of sleeping alone.", "answer": "Night is hard for a lot of people, so you are definitely not alone here. Has anything scary ever happened to you at night? Answering that question may give you the \"why\" of where that's coming from. If you haven't had a bad experience at night, it may just be the time when you have nothing to do, which allows more intense thoughts and feelings to surface. Here's a couple things to try:One thing you could do is sit down a couple hours before you go to bed and journal (if you can). Try to reduce any distractions and just go for it. The purpose of this is to slow down well before you go to bed, expressing some of the anxiety from the day. Also take note of the things you can tackle that day vs what can wait until later. This gives your brain a chance to sort through some of the \"planning\" type of anxiety that commonly comes up when you are trying to sleep.Another thing you can do is make a list of the things you have control over. Anxiety is really good at putting everything you feel out of control of on a giant metaphorical projection screen. Try projecting some of the things you have control over instead. For example--you have total control over breathing patterns, what you choose to wear the next day, what you pay attention to if you go for a walk, etc. You also have control over how you personalize that list to what matters to you. Mindfulness is a great way to focus on how you control your breath, and also how letting go of breathing doesn't stop your body from doing what it's always doing to keep you alive. Any google search will bring up lots of information on this!Something to remember is that experiencing anxiety is OK. It doesn't mean something is necessarily wrong. Anxiety is sometimes just a feeling that comes up without much of a cause. If you can't identify that cause, it's probably because of a little misinterpretation in the brain. Mindfulness can definitely help with that.", "topic": "anxiety"}
{"id": "counsel_00175", "question": "I’m a teenager. I am almost always paranoid. Recently, I started to think they watch. I keep seeing in the corner of my eye someone moving. The other night, I heard breathing in my room, and my eyes focused on a black shape. I turned on the lights, but no one was there.", "answer": "I've worked with teens in a day treatment program for about 6 years now and it's been a theme that a lot of them see dark figures out of the corner of their eyes. Pretty common with teens that have endured trauma--physical or sexual abuse, witnessing domestic violence, etc. We don't have a lot of information on why this happens, but it's theorized that the brain projects the emotions outside of us in the form of dark figures--maybe just as a reflection of what is existing on the inside of the brain or even to give some emotional relief. When we have kids that have experienced those types of hallucinations, they almost always disappear once they have worked through their trauma. Sometimes visual and auditory hallucinations are symptoms of mental health disorders as well, though that's pretty rare for those to start as early as the teens years. It's best to have your symptoms checked out by a medical professional and maybe even a psychiatrist to get a better idea of what may be happening. Are you or have you been taking any medications that could potentially have these side effects? If you do visit one or both professionals, make sure you or a caregiver is giving them all the details about your symptoms so they can help you as much as possible.A big question here is what is your sleep like? Lack of sleep is notorious for causing hallucinations and can become severe after only a few nights of sleep deprivation. If you are having trouble sleeping, that may be another topic to discuss with your doctor.No matter what it is, it's obviously scary otherwise you wouldn't feel paranoid. Try some techniques to calm yourself a few times during the day, like deep breathing or movement-based strategies like yoga. Whatever speaks to you.

I'm always the last one to fall asleep and the first to wake. I hate falling asleep. The longest I've went without sleep is three days.", "answer": "No wonder you are scared to sleep if this is what you are going through.My first thought is that it's possible your dreams are your brain's way of trying to process something that scares you or has scared you. There's not a lot of research on the purpose of dreams, but one theory is that stuff you don't want to deal with consciously is able to come through via your unconscious brain as a dream (or nightmare). Another theory is more of Gestalt nature, where all your dream figures represent a part of you--for example, the part of you being attacked would be the side of you that feels weak, whereas the attacker is the side of you that you feel is bad or evil. Either way, your reactions are definitely legit because nightmares tend to flood the brain in a pretty emotionally raw form.I am also curious if you had trouble sleeping before you started having these dreams. Is it because of these nightmares that sleep is an issue, or have the sleep issues been a part of your life longer than the dreams? It may not mean a whole lot no matter what order they came in, but it would be interesting to know if the catalyst was actually the dreams to begin with. The big question here is if not having these nightmares would improve your sleep and lessen your anxiety about sleeping, overall.As for the anxiety attacks, there's a lot here you can try. Your brain is seeing sleep, nightmares, or both as a threat. The way to signal safety to your brain is to practice some relaxation techniques--mindful breathing can be helpful or if you find it hard to sit still, you can do some walking mindfulness. Maybe you've heard of the Calm app--it's so great for sleep issues. They have sleep stories and soundscapes, as well as guided breathing exercises. This is speaking more to the thinking process, but remind yourself that the dreams aren't real and they can't hurt you. That doesn't mean you won't have anxiety and you have to fully believe it, it just means that you don't have to get caught up in the fear response. You also mention that they \"try\" to hurt you. Have you ever done things to fight them off? Or do you run? It's OK if your response is to freeze--I'm just curious how you view yourself in that dream. If you are feeling powerless (which would be normal) it may be worth your time to imagine how you want to fight them off. What weapons would you choose? What would escape look like? Imagining you in charge may help change your experience of the dreams.Also remember that even though panic attacks feel awful, they won't hurt you. It's a really terrifying feeling to be trapped in your body during an attack, but the response is meant to get us out of danger even though there is no real threat. If you do a google search for panic attack help sites, there's so many that detail more of this response and how to move through an attack. Of course, seeing a counselor might be beneficial if you are sensing that there's something bigger underlying the dreams. Sometimes just having someone listen and understand can ease some suffering.I hope that helps and you find something that works for you!", "topic": "anxiety"}
{"id": "counsel_00178", "question": "I've been having horrible anxiety for the last week. I can't sleep. I get a sense of doom, and it's hard to breathe. I feel like nothing I do makes it better.", "answer": "That really sucks to go through. There are tons of ways to work with anxiety, both directly and indirectly that can help with what you are dealing with.Do you think you may be experiencing a panic attack? Sounds like you are feeling some dread about what will happen to you and physical symptoms common with attacks. Panic attacks are the body's way of trying to alert you to danger, whether that is real or perceived. It's not something your body does against you, but instead to keep you safe by keeping you in a state where you could react quickly (run, fight, etc.). This can happen even if there aren't any real threats and you logically know you are safe. Even if you aren't having panic attacks, that heightened anxiety can still feel really awful and exhausting.What have you done so far that is not working? When the brain is in that \"danger\" mode, talking it down tends to be unsuccessful--this is very evident in bounds of research we have on how the brain functions. The part of the brain that senses threats and triggers anxiety responses reacts more effectively to body signals to relax---such as controlled breathing. Mindfulness breathing techniques have a lot of value for this reason and there are many options available (apps like Calm and Headspace, youtube guided videos, etc). Try to keep in mind that having anxiety doesn't mean that you are actually in any danger, and mindfulness is not meant to be an escape. It does help to regulate and make you feel more in control of your body. Your anxiety will always come back down--you can even track it to see the real-time changes that happen. It's normal for it to rise and fall a few times during a panic attack, so if you notice a rise, it has no meaning other than that you're body is normally going through it's anxiety response.I think seeing a doctor is a great idea to rule out any other issues happening within the body. Some medical issues can materialize as anxiety and depression. Depending on your symptoms, they may even suggest a medication developed for these issues.Anxiety is one of the top researched symptoms, so we do have tons of research available on what works and what's less effective. We know that talking alone doesn't reduce the body's fear response, unless talking is the method of exposure (talking about a traumatic experience, talking within a group if you have social anxiety, etc.). For the brain to learn you are safe, it takes experience via exposure while riding the wave of anxiety. For example, if you fear vomiting, you would expose yourself to things that remind you of vomiting and breathe through the anxiety you feel without avoiding the triggers. That would teach your brain that those triggers are actually benign, and would no longer create that panicky response. It'd be difficult to say what that may look like for you, or even if you need that, but it could be worth connecting with a counselor (even online) to discuss these options.

{"id": "counsel_00181", "question": "A lot of times, I avoid situations where I am to meet new people because I have a fear of embarrassing myself. I often avoid large groups of people, like parties, because I think they all constantly judge me.", "answer": "Hello, and thank you for your question. First, I want you to know that you are certainly not alone on this issue. Everyone, at some point in time, has a fear of public embarrassment. But for many people, this fear can become so awful that it begins to have a real negative impact on their quality of life. They will try to avoid any situation that they even THINK will cause them embarrassment or anxiety. Escaping a possible embarrassing moment by avoiding or isolating may cause some relief at first, but then many times the avoidance will eventually lead to loneliness, isolation, and even despair. By avoiding, we can also miss out on things that make us feel alive and bring enjoyment. There are many self-help books that offer advice on this issue. You can do an internet search, and I recommend reading the reviews of the book. That is great way to find out if others have found the book helpful. Another option is to seek a counselor to help you with this fear. I would recommend a counselor who specializes in helping people who have anxiety or social anxiety. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is a good choice for helping with anxiety, but there are many others. The truth is that anxiety and fear of embarrassing ourselves is not something that any of us will ever \"get over\", but we can learn to respond to those feelings differently. A colleague may offer some other advice, as well.. Be wellRobin Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC", "topic": "anxiety"}
{"id": "counsel_00182", "question": "I’ve been on 0.5 mg of Xanax twice a day for the past month. It hasn't been helping me at all, but when I take 1 mg during a big anxiety attack, it calms me down. I was wondering how I can ask my psychologist to up the dose to 1 mg twice a day without her thinking I'm abusing them. I just have very big anxiety attacks. Should I stay on the 0.5mg and deal with the attacks or should I ask to up the dose? I'm afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else.", "answer": "It seems like what you are looking for is a way to advocate for yourself and that's so important in mental health! You know best what is working for you and what isn't, so you are the best person to speak out for yourself to the people that can help you. I have extensive training in substance abuse and medications used in therapy, and I work with many people that take Xanax. Counselors may not prescribe, but with the right training we can educate and help you move through the complexities of medication usage when paired with therapy. There's definitely some debate about using medication in the counseling world, but many people are prescribed Xanax to cope with big emotional responses. We don't know much about your situation here--if you are in counseling, what types of other coping skills you've tried to use, etc., so it'd be hard to suggest not taking anything for your symptoms. You are obviously struggling and sometimes stabilization is the best you can do. And the fact that you are considering dealing with the attacks as an option is a sign you are willing to negotiate your dosage and maybe even the intense fear you are experiencing. That's seriously so courageous.A little bit about Xanax--Xanax is a drug in the Benzodiazepine family and is fast-acting. That means it does only help short-term, but your body also builds a tolerance to it pretty quickly (just as people build tolerance to alcohol). That could be why they aren't as effective for you at the dosage you are taking, especially if you are prescribed to take them twice a day. It's really important that you discuss the symptoms you are still having with your prescribing provider, as well as when you are taking the medications so they understand the details of your situation and can determine if or how to modify your dosage. These providers know a lot about the medication process and the more info they have, the better they can meet your needs. They are ultimately the ones that will work with you to decide whether or not Xanax is the best for you and your situation.I definitely understand your concern that your provider may basically take away how you cope with panic attacks. That's a scary thought! Prescribing providers are typically trained in detecting medication abuse, and it is very common for people with anxiety issues to request higher dosages. I have had plenty of clients ask for increased dosage. Not only can this get you the assistance you need at the time you need it, but give you a voice in your treatment. You may end up using that same voice for request to lower your dosage in the future.I do feel an ethical duty to let you know about some of the dangers of Xanax. Benzodiazepines are depressants and work on the central nervous system (CNS) to do things like slow down your heart rate, breathing, etc. (as you can feel when they do work). They should never be taken with any other depressants, such as alcohol, barbiturates, and other medications in the Benzo family. Combinations like these could be fatal.Another danger is that there's a common pattern of relapse after discontinuing Xanax. This means that symptoms tend to come back stronger than they were before taking the drug. The reason for this is because when you are taking Xanax, your brain tries to intensify your fear reaction to override the drug. So when you discontinue it, your fear reactions are still at those heightened levels. Your prescribing provider can talk to you more about that and/or the process of tapering off the medication to make that less likely when that time comes for you.If you are in counseling and doing exposure activities, (being exposed to things you fear and sitting through the anxiety response) Xanax does interfere with this process. The brain can't learn a different response if you feel calm. This is something your counselor (if you have one) can discuss with you as well.The last thing I'd like to say is that there could be some value to practicing other ways to manage your anxiety if you want to make more long-term changes. That decision is completely yours! If/when you feel ready to do that, a counselor can help you learn how to move through anxiety without being as reliant on Xanax. I hope this is helpful and you find what you need!", "topic": "anxiety"}
{"id": "counsel_00183", "question": "I just about fall asleep then I can't help but sit up and walk around.", "answer": "This is very common! Sleep is when we are most vulnerable and it requires our bodies to let go of control and lose awareness of a lot of our environment. Has anything bad ever happened to you at night or when you were sleeping? This could be something to consider. Your body may be feeling a need to protect you by not letting you relax and instead keeping you awake and aware to anything around you.Could you be worrying about what is happening the following day? It's also normal to have pressures of the next day rolling through our minds before our bodies commit to sleep. If you pay attention to what you are thinking about before bed, that could tell you a lot about what you worry about in your life.Not everyone is into meditation or mindfulness, but these methods can help send the message to your brain that you are safe. There are some pretty neat apps like Calm and Headspace, or mindfulness videos on youtube that have a variety of tools to fit what you may need. It may take a while for these to really start to show results, so keep at it if you have the chance.Journaling can also be a great way to release some of the stress from the day and silence the mind a bit. Consulting with a doctor may also be a plus if your sleep continues to be impacted. Not having proper sleep can lead to more anxiety and reduce the body's capabilities to regulate emotion, leading to worsened sleep. Sometimes having a buffer there can help get your sleep on a better track while you work on the anxiety. Hope you find some of this helpful!", "topic": "anxiety"}
{"id": "counsel_00184", "question": "I'm just an extremely paranoid person. I constantly feel as though I am in some sort of danger, like as though I live in a horror movie with no resolution. It worsens at night. It gets to the point I'm scared in my own home more so than anything. I have no access to the help I need so I'm desperate.", "answer": "That really sucks and I'm sorry that's happening to you.I'm curious what kind of paranoia you are experiencing--like someone will hurt you? That something bad in general will happen? Sometimes intrusive thoughts, like paranoid thoughts, are just thoughts. They don't mean you are actually in danger or that something bad will happen, so pay attention to the meaning you apply to those thoughts. If you've been through something traumatic such as rape, domestic violence, or any situation like that, it could provoke paranoia bigtime. Your brain feels as if it has to be \"hypervigilant\", meaning it has to be extra attuned to everything around you to keep you safe. That's exhausting. If it's worse at night that probably means you aren't getting much sleep--also exhausting and contributes to heightened paranoia, so it becomes a pretty vicious cycle.It's not shocking that it's worse at night because night is generally a scarier time and sleeping is, physically, when we are in our most vulnerable state. It can help to take a look at how much of that paranoia is actually helping you to protect yourself vs. how much is additional stress. A way to figure that out is to ask the question, what behaviors are necessary to keep you safe? So if you lock your doors, lock the windows, shut the curtains, have an escape plan (if needed--I'm not sure what your situation is), is that the most you can do? Beyond that, are you performing other behaviors that may not be keeping you safe but exist to cope with the paranoia? For example, if you are checking over and over to make sure the doors and windows are locked, those behaviors are more like compulsions/rituals that help you feel safe by reducing anxiety even though they use a ton of energy to perform. Response prevention can be helpful here--this method involves avoiding your usual response so that you can sit with the anxiety rather than escaping it through the behaviors. Let's say your anxiety rises and you feel the need to check the door lock. You check the lock, it's for sure locked, and your anxiety is reduced. At the same time, the behavior of checking the lock is reinforced by feeling better, so your brain decides if you want to feel better, you need to check the lock. It becomes an exhausting habit that only temporarily makes you feel safe. However, if you feel a bout of anxiety and sit through it without checking the lock, your anxiety will go back down and your brain learns that you don't need to perform that behavior over and over. I'm so sad to hear you don't have access to help. There may be some counselors right now offering reduced-rate or probono (free) sessions via telehealth due to COVID-19, so if you search around on google for your specific state, you may find someone that can help you from your home.

Fear can be tricky in the sense that it quite often masquerades as something that seems under our control. For example, your fear of touching a girl may actually be a fear of being incompetently intimate or a bad fiance--It's easier to deal with those fears by avoiding touch because that gives you control and how else would you deal with those fears? I wonder if your fiance can be of any help to you. It's scary to admit fears to people close to us but they can also offer some of the best support if that's been something you've experienced with her in the past.It sounds like you are really hard on yourself as well. It's normal to have anxiety about your first time having sex---that's a really special milestone! Maybe it's worth looking into performance anxiety tips?

{"id": "counsel_00186", "question": "I shake and have panic attacks.", "answer": "So glad you are reaching out. Panic attacks are very frightening.For some reason (and I promise there is one) your brain is sending off false alarms even though you are probably safe. This is called the fight or flight response and part of the body's way of fighting off perceived threats (including those that are not genuinely dangerous).Some reasons people have panic attacks is if they are under too much emotional or physical stress, any type of exhaustion or lack of sleep, history of trauma, unprocessed emotions, etc. You don't have to know why you are having panic attacks to work with them, but it can help to understand its origins and target them at the source.Something to know is that the presence of anxiety does not mean you are in any danger, no matter how much your body is elevated. Anxiety is just our body's way of letting us know something is off, though it often exaggerates the response because it doesn't always operate from a place of logic. Triggers could be as small as a word, smell, time of day, or really anything. Triggers can also be physical sensations inside our bodies. Though panic attacks are very scary and feel incredibly uncomfortable, they will not kill you.What message might your body be sending you via panic attacks? Is there any area of your life you could step away from at all to give yourself some relief? If you pay attention to when panic attacks happen, that could clue you into what is setting off that false alarm.Some apps that are really great for relaxation and use breathing techniques are Calm, Headspace, PanicShield, etc. Try some out and see which ones really fit for your needs. Breathing is a great tool because you always have it right there with you and it's something you can control when it feels like your body is out of control.", "topic": "anxiety"}

I like kids and don't know why I'm so scared to be around them. I don't understand why I feel like this. Am I a bad person? How do I make this stop?", "answer": "Your very concern about your response to being around children shows that you aren't a bad person--it actually speaks to that you care. Panic attacks are really scary and not easy to deal with. I wonder what you mean by paranoia--does this mean you are worried about your body's response when you are around kids? Do you worry about their behavior? Or does paranoia for you mean that you are worried about other people's judgments of you because of panicking? If what you are saying is that you are trying to fight off the anxious feelings you have, it could intensify your symptoms because emotions want to be acknowledged. One way to help manage through that is via deep breathing. You can check out some videos on youtube that you vibe with and the nice thing about practicing this is it's very easy to do in public without people noticing.I'm also curious about more of the details of what your experience is like. Are there certain age ranges or behaviors that trigger your anxiety? Figuring out the specifics of what sparks that response in your body will give you some basic insight into why you are feeling that way and what types of situations to prepare yourself for.

{"id": "counsel_00188", "question": "I am a peaceful person, but I often find myself having thoughts about killing people. Eventhough I like the thoughts at the time, they make me cry. Why do I feel like this?", "answer": "Let me point a couple things out to you. These thoughts obviously go against your core values, otherwise they wouldn't upset you! Having thoughts about killing people bugs you, and that's a GOOD sign. You are also concerned enough to reach out on this chat forum. That tells me you have put some time into worrying about these thoughts and what they mean.There's absolutely nothing wrong with a thought. We all have extreme thoughts in life because our brains are built to wander. Unless you are acting on these thoughts, they are not dangerous. It's important to note that having a thought doesn't mean you are that thought. It's pretty easy to assume that our thoughts are who we are, but that couldn't be less true. If we were our thoughts, we'd be so many different things at once it'd be unimaginable!Something I wonder is if these thoughts feel intrusive to you. Even if you enjoy them, do they seem to show up without invitation? When a thought is intrusive in nature, it can often make someone feel as if it is uncontrollable and holds more weight than less intrusive thoughts. It is also interesting that you mention finding pleasure in thinking about killing in the sense that it's definitely giving you some psychological relief in the moment. From that, I have two thoughts: 1) could it mean you are trying to cope with something socially upsetting to you via these types of thoughts? and 2) I'm wondering if there is any repressed anger in your life. You mention being a peaceful person. Are you usually the peacemaker in your social world? Do you feel as if people take advantage of you or that you don't have a voice? Those situations can breed anger and resentment. If you don't allow yourself to feel or express anger, the brain will find a way to do it for you and it's not weird or strange that it would want to send out thoughts that clearly get your attention!Another thing you could try is tracking when the thoughts come up. Keeping a log can help shed light on what may be triggering them and what their purpose may seem to be.Wishing you all the best!", "topic": "anxiety"}

You may be right, your physical symptoms of getting sick to your stomach may very well be your nerves or anxiety. That is totally normal and understandable given your circumstances.

I just want to get better.", "answer": "I don't know how old you are, but in Pennsylvania, if you are over 14, you can have therapy without your parents' consent. If you are young enough to use their insurance, that could be complicated, but depending on the state, there may be ways to work around that as well. If transportation is a problem, call a local mental health agency and see if they can connect you with assistance.In the meantime, try searching for a phone helpline in the county where you live. They may be able to help you figure out where you can get help.Another idea is that if you are in school, your guidance counselor may be able to provide links to where you can go for help. He or she may also be able to give you more specific ideas to help with your panic attacks.I know you said your mom refuses to offer help, which included seeing a doctor, but I wonder if she trusts the doctors that is your primary care physician (also called a family doctor) who you see when you have a minor medical ailment that may need medication. That doctor may be able to help you as well.Some of the information here may be helpful to you because it explains some of what anxiety is and there are some quizzes there that may give you information to discuss with a doctor or therapist when you get connected with one. http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/mental-health-anxiety-disorders This may give you other information to speak with your mom about.

You may find that \"talking\" to others through the internet is more comfortable and you are great at it, or that you love one on one talking but aren't really made for group talking. There is a place in this world for you either way! Public speaking skills can be practiced in speech class, or toastmaster group, they will give you practice in a safe environment where the cool kids or cutest boy aren't ready to laugh at you. What topics are you interested in and what groups can you do a little speaking up? Maybe in your small group at church try and raise you hand to share your opinion, or maybe your Girl Scout troop? Look around for a peer and one adult who you like to hear speak out, ask them to share with you 2 things that help them feel comfortable speaking in public. Check out some Ted Talks and see how they share in groups. Social anxiety is a difficult concern and picking apart what is your awesome personality and what needs skill building and mindfulness/anxiety help are important steps.

{"id": "counsel_00206", "question": "I have been having a lot of nightmares where I am being killed in different ways. I either wake up in a panic or just crying and sweating. It has made me terrified of falling asleep and is now affecting my daily life too. Can I make the nightmares stop?", "answer": "Hello, and thank you for your question. Sleep problems, including insomnia and even the nightmares that you are writing about, are really common for people and so many people suffer from them. Here are a few things to consider or to try: 1. Have you changed or started taking any new medication lately? Medications can certainly affect your sleep and some can even cause vivid or frightening dreams. If you are taking a new medication, talk to your provider about the nightmares, this may be the cause. 2. Stress can certainly increase our difficulty with sleep and can also begin to affect our dream states. The dreams may not make much sense, but then again even good dreams don't always make much sense. Ask yourself, do I have any new or renewed stressors in my life? Work, school, relationships, health.... all of these areas and many more are places where stress can hide out. If this is the case, talk with your provider or consider seeing a counselor who may be able to help. 3. Something to consider is that once we start to have anxiety or stress about something, we can begin to obsess about it. My guess is that going to bed for sleep is no longer a pleasant thing for you. Your stress and fear of what may happen when you sleep could start way before you actually go to bed. This could increase your chances of having another bad dream. Try relaxation techniques before going to bed. If you have YouTube, you can pull up \"Guided Meditation for Sleep\" exercises to help you relax. There are many different ones to choose from. You may also want to try deep breathing.4. There are self-help ideas for managing bad nightmares. If you Google search \"Nightmare Rescripting\" or \"Nightmare Exposure\" you may find some ideas and instructions on how to manage dreams. I hope these ideas help. Be well... Robin J.

{"id": "counsel_00208", "question": "I'm concerned about my boyfriend. I suffer from anxiety, but I always have this feeling he wants to hurt me because he told me he was interested in BDSM intercourse. We haven't tried it, but I've had this feeling he always wants to.", "answer": "Hello! Thank you for your question. There are few things that people find more personal than their sexual relationships. When we feel connected to our partner, sex can be best thing since sliced bread. However, if we feel disconnected in some way, sex can feel degrading and even painful. I don’t know the specifics about your relationship or how comfortable you are in talking to your boyfriend, but this is one of those situations where communicating your fears is a good idea. The only exception to that would be if you believe he is actually a threat to you in some way. If you believe that, then you should do whatever you think is safe. It sounds like there is a part of you that is already afraid of him, and if that is the case then remaining safe is your top priority. Assuming you are able to share with him your feelings, telling him what you are and are not interested in sexually is very appropriate and sexually healthy. Sex is something that is supposed to be enjoyable for all parties. All parties should feel respected and able to say “no” to absolutely anything they are not comfortable with. I call the respectful agreement between sexual partners, “sex trust.” Sex Trust means your partner respects your boundaries. It means they won’t degrade you sexually with hurtful words, forced sex, or forcing or coercing sex in ways someone is not interested in having. Your personal safety and mental well-being is what is most important. Now, if there is a part of you that is curious about BDSM and may be interested in participating in it, there are many websites that you can explore to learn information. I will warn you, some websites and articles are better or worse than others, but you may at least feel more informed. Many people engage in BDSM and have happy relationships, but again, it completely depends on what each person in the relationship wants. It is also important to know that BDSM is not just one thing and people practice it differently based on comfort. If it is something you are uncomfortable with, then you shouldn’t feel obligated to do it. I hope this was helpful. Be well. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC", "topic": "anxiety"}
{"id": "counsel_00209", "question": "I get so much anxiety, and I don’t know why. I feel like I can’t do anything by myself because I’m scared of the outcomes.", "answer": "This is a very common question in my practice. Panic attacks typically emerge from an underlying issue (ex. Depression, low self-esteem, fears). To decrease your anxiety symptoms it’s recommended to seek treatment with a therapist who specializes in working with anxiety disorders and most importantly one with whom you feel comfortable with.In my practice I educate clients about their anxiety and discuss building a framework with helpful tools for decreasing anxiety:1. Starting a daily mindfulness practice. For example: listening to guided meditation; engaging in deep breathing exercises; yoga practice; or other positive calming activities.2. Understand your negative and positive thoughts. Many times we tend to focus on the potential for bad things to happen. Increase positive self-talk when feeling down or when anxious. For example: \"I don't need to worry, I am calm and relaxed\". 3. Exposure to fearful or anxious situations. This can be accomplished under the care of a mental health professional. Many times we shy away from things that make us feel uncomfortable or insecure. This may led to an increase in isolating behaviors resulting in difficulty in performing things we were once able to do. For example: leaving the house; presenting in front of others; going to social events; and having conversations with people. However, the more we expose ourselves and practice the use of our positive coping skills (ex. deep breathing) the chances of anxiety will decrease. I hope this was helpful. Keep in mind, a therapist can help with guiding you through self relaxation and improvement.", "topic": "anxiety"}

I do not like to assume so I will direct you to information regarding families dealing with enmeshment and triangulation. Enmeshment is the concept of diffused boundaries in families and other personal relationships. Triangulation is two individuals relaying information to a third party what cannot be said directly to each other. From someone who has dealt with both these issues on a personal level, being informed about family dynamics is beneficial and can help you develop healthy boundaries for yourself within your family structure. You may need assistance with developing healthy boundaries. Although it is possible, it is not easy to change the way you have been operating for any extended amount of time.

{"id": "counsel_00211", "question": "Whenever I have to speak in public or be in big crowds, I freak out. I get light-headed, sweaty, and I have trouble breathing.", "answer": "Basically, your response is the fight, flight or freeze reaction which is hard wired into the human nervous system, specifically, the autonomic nervous system (called the autonomic response). This system is responsible for regulating the heart, digestion, respiratory rate as well as other aspects which match the symptoms you describe. It is largely an unconscious function, but with training it can be managed such as a public speaking course in which you prepare and even have some exposure to smaller experiences to help you prepare and cope for larger presentations. One of the greatest applications of addressing this response is the NASA program which exposes the astronauts to situations they will encounter while in space which will trigger the response so that when it does happen (not if but when) that they are able to move through the challenge with success. You can learn more about his by going to TED Talks “What I learned about going blind in space” It is a truly inspiring look at what you are experiencing as well as how to deal with it. With that being said, finding a program like a Dale Carnegie Public Speaking program can help. Working with a counselor who can help you utilize visualization of an upcoming speech has been shown to help and you can always talk to your doctor to see what options might be available there as well.

I still know that it's the same one, and then I wake up in a panic, and I cry really loud without knowing the reason. Why do I see the same dream, why can I not remember it, and what should I do to remember it?", "answer": "There is no scientifically established formula for understanding dreams, that I know about, however, many people get a great deal of value from exploring what their dreams mean. It is believed by many that our dreams contain metaphors that represent meaningful patterns in our lives and relationships and if we pay attention to them we can learn important things about ourselves. One thing you might try, to see if you can get more insight into the dream and possibly begin remembering things, is to take note of whatever you do remember, any details about your experience, such as when do you wake up from the dream, how do you feel, both emotionally and physically, what are you thinking about when you wake up, is there any pattern in terms of what happens to you in your waking life around the time you have this dream... If you can keep a journal or a recording device to speak into by your bed, you can try to record whatever you do remember and notice as soon as you wake up.

It just adds to the reasonableness of talking with each other about how living together feels to each of you.Psychiatrists earn their living by diagnosing people and telling them to take pills. Very often, just being told the person has a \"condition\" makes them feel fragile and less capable than they actually are.Anxiety and panic attacks do mean that there is a great deal of emotion and situation needing to be addressed.It is the normal sign of having to address many or deep matters.

I'd like to hear some ways I can work on not needing to feel so much in control all the time.", "answer": "Hi Biddeford,This is a super goal. Feeling powerless is something parents are wise to get used to; there's a creature in the home whose job it is to find and use their power in the family and in the world. Of course your toddler defies you, and that's healthy. I worry more about the overly compliant ones. She is wanting to know what the rules are, and all you have to do is show her clearly where the lines are. I'll give you some tips.First, remind yourself that it's her job to learn what the rules are, and where her power is. Don't be so surprised when she wants it her way. If we go through our days being ready and prepared for these beautiful creatures to have minds of their own, we're less caught off guard when it happens. Avoid situations that invite power struggles. Any time you tell your daughter \"do this now\", you set up a power struggle. The good thing is that she's young enough you can pick her up; now is the time to teach her that mom's (or dad's) word means something. So, if you say \"let's get you dressed\", then be prepared to pick her up right away and show her that when you say something will happen, you can make it happen. And I'm talking about gently picking her up here...not roughly. Pick your battles; only give instructions when you have the power to make it happen.Give her choices, so she can see her power. Instead of opening her drawer and asking what she wants to wear, give her two choices. Here's an example...she's on the ipad and you say ipad time is over. She says \"no\". You can say \"ipad time is over. If you put it down, you can play later. If I have to take it away, you don't play it later.\" The choice is hers. Then follow through.\"When...then\" statements are really helpful. Your child asks for something. Instead of saying no, try \"as soon as the toys are picked up, we can have a snack\". You're simply a pleasant parent who wants the same thing they do...but they have to earn it. Staying calm yourself is the key, because then at least you will feel in control of yourself, which is the ultimate goal. Use self-talk to calm yourself. Remind yourself her behaviour is normal and healthy. Breathe through a moment in which you would have reacted, and it will be over by the time the breath is done. You can give yourself time to think before you make parenting decisions. Time is a useful tool not enough parents use. Good luck!", "topic": "anxiety"}

You feel self-loathing for both being a virgin, and for being sexually active. Young women have always gotten crazy mixed messages about what they're supposed to be. They feel pressure to be pure, and they also feel pressure to be the vixen and please men sexually. But you can't be both, so you can't ever win if you buy into all that horse manure (excuse my language). This current hook-up culture puts added pressure on girls to expect nothing more than random sexual encounters that leave you feeling empty and used; perhaps desirable in that moment but mostly worthless. The stupid part is that research tells us that young men are also impacted negatively by this cultural norm that values sex and not relationship; they feel guilt, and loneliness. I urge you to talk to other girls and women about your feelings. My hope and prayer is that they will echo my words here.Your value and power cannot ever be found in whether a man wants you, whether you turn his eye, or how he treats you. Your sexuality is a beautiful part of who you are, and it is to be celebrated. I love that you want to celebrate it with someone who cares. Who you are is so very much more than your sexuality. You sound like you have a lot of things going for you. Try to see all of those things when you think of yourself.There are many more virgins out there, and many are afraid, like you, that they don't fit in. We are all different, and you don't have to be anything but who you want to be; who you are. You don't have to have any kind of sex until you're ready, and that makes you brave and smart, not weird.You're tall and beautiful, and guys may be intimidated by that. It may take time for you to meet the right guy, but he's out there. The question is: How do you want to spend your time until he crosses your path?

{"id": "counsel_00226", "question": "I have a lot of issues going on right now. First of all, I have a lot of trouble sleeping at times, while other nights I sleep too much and still feel quite tired. I’m also noticing increased irritability and experiencing anxiety attacks that last for hours. Is there something wrong with me and if so what should I do?", "answer": "Hi there. I have to commend you on reaching out to get some answers on why you are feeling the way that you are feeling. A lot of people secretly go about their lives every day feeling this way because they are too afraid of what the answer might be.First off, what stressors do you have in your life right now? Financial, relationship and unemployment are all common stressors for people. They can often make it difficult for us to sleep at night due to the constant racing thoughts and wonders of how you will deal with it all. Secondly, do you have a history of depression or does depression run in your family? Some of the symptoms listed here in this question (i.e. trouble sleeping, constant fatigue, too much sleep, anger & anxiety) are all common symptoms of depression. Often times, these symptoms can be overlooked and mistaken for \"just being tired.\" Furthermore, it's important to ask yourself, if you are feeling worthless, problems with concentration and recurrent thoughts of death. If you are having these symptoms, please seek help IMMEDIATELY. Lastly, considering your stated symptoms I would recommend reaching out to your Doctor for further consult. It's always better to be safe and the earlier you catch the symptoms the faster you will get to feeling better! do Some helpful tips for the your Doctor would be to monitor your sleep habits (i.e. how much or little are you sleeping), make a list of your triggers for your anger outbursts as well as your triggers for your anxiety attacks. I hope this was helpful and the best of luck to you.", "topic": "anxiety"}
{"id": "counsel_00227", "question": "I feel that I need to end my present relationship. He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion. Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I can't continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We have gone through this cycle already 4-5 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile.", "answer": "It sounds like you have some insight into the cycle that you describe with your current relationship and at the same time you are still feeling stuck. It also sounds like the distressing feelings that you experience, when you imagine what will happen for you and your current partner, are pretty overwhelming.

I know I can't afford a therapist so I don't know what my problem is, but I think I might have social anxiety.", "answer": "If you are noticing that anxiety tends to be triggered around interactions with others, then you may have social anxiety. Working with a therapist, you may be able to gain insight into the nature of the anxiety, develop tools for coping with it, and take steps that may alleviate it over time, so that you can enjoy your interactions with others. If you are short on money, there still may be options for you to be able to see a therapist. Check with your insurance provider about your behavioral health coverage. If you have medicaid/apple care, there are some private practice therapists who accept this form of insurance, as well as community clinics which do. If you are not insured, some therapists and clinics will work on a sliding fee scale, and accept either low fee or may even work with you pro-bono (for free).", "topic": "anxiety"}

Feelings are never wrong, but it can help to understand where they come from and talk to someone who can teach you healthy ways to cope. Self-harm is not the answer to managing those emotions you feel in your stomach. Although I'm glad you said something here, a professional would need to spend some time with you and get a deep understanding of your life in order to help you sort all these reactions out effectively.

{"id": "counsel_00230", "question": "I was raped repeatedly when I was younger. I told my parents and action was taken, but now that I’m an adult, I suffer from extreme anxiety.", "answer": "While anxiety can come about for many reasons, trauma is definitely one of the factors that makes anxiety a possibility both immediately following a traumatic event and later in life. When we have experienced such scary violations of our bodies - we may experience residual effects of fear for many years to come. This is normal, natural and in many ways helpful - at least initially. This fear is in some way a sign that your body/mind is taking good care of you - trying to keep you on your toes in order to protect you from anything terrible happening to you again. However, as it sounds like you know, anxiety feels awful and there are certainly ways of learning to reduce anxiety. In order to get the tools you need to manage anxiety and also understand where it comes from and how it works in your life, I would encourage you to seek professional help and check out anxiety resources online.", "topic": "anxiety"}

But there are also lots of examples of folks who have successfully worked their way through this. So there is hope! In addition to the suggestion to visit your doctor (who may prescribe a medication to help you relax), there are many social service agencies who provide free counseling or take medicaid. A good CBT therapist will help you look at your thinking so that you may see how you are distorting your thoughts. Behavior is also important. Despite how you may feel: it is helpful to go out, to do things that relax you (maybe a yoga class or a meditation class?). Exercise. Diet. Eat well. Think back on the things that you used to do that helped in the past, and force yourself to do these things again. I know that this seems hard, but it beats the alternative, doesn't it?

{"id": "counsel_00233", "question": "I feel like my time is going too fast", "answer": "Thank you for reaching out! That is a great question! As an American, I can truly say that I spend way too much time on the go! It is a proven fact that Americans live in a fast paced environment compared to Europe! I often ask myself, what if I only had one day left on this Earth? What would I do? Well, that is an easy question. I would spend it with my family! Easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of World, right? Its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bring.Time management is a very important factor when learning to \"live life to the fullest\"! In fact, this is a required course in undergraduate college now. Everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this. Personally, for myself I like to keep a calendar with a to-do list. I always place my most important tasks at the top of the list. That way, if I do not get through the list, I am not stressing over the little things. When planning your day, it is important you schedule work, eat and play. A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work, it must be done. There is discipline involved in this process. If you have trouble with this, then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spouse/partner reminding you that this is a time for play and not work.These are just some ideas that I am throwing out there. Again, everyone has their own style on time management. I hope this was helpful for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out for anything further!", "topic": "anxiety"}

Recently however, it's been getting to the point where I feel pressured and unable to speak my mind. It isn't possible for me to get professional one-on-one help. He tells me to grow a pair and get over it. I recently have been developing more severe body image and self-confidence issues, which I have had all my life. I feel invalidated by my dad. I have been more paranoid lately as well. I can't turn on location services anymore on my phone because of a past incident. He makes me feel guilty about it.

It sounds like you are experiencing a great deal of anxiety that needs to be addressed by a professional (despite the fact that you are unable to at the moment). I would recommend talking with another adult such as a school counselor that can offer you support in this area. Perhaps they can work with you on your anxiety issues and schedule a meeting with your parents so that he/she may help mediate the conversation with them.If you are unable to reach out to a school counselor maybe you can try a member of the family such as an aunt or an uncle that feels comfortable addressing the issue with your parents.

I'm taking medications to control them, but I'm thinking of moving in with her since I get so anxious.", "answer": "I’m sorry to hear that you are currently experiencing panic attacks. I hope that the medication you have been prescribed has provided you with some relief. Unfortunately, I don’t feel that moving in with your girlfriend would alleviate your anxiety. Although you may feel very anxious about leaving her, your body is reacting to this stressful event in your life in an unhealthy manner. You may be able to render this particular situation but it’s likely that you may experience another panic attack when an additional stressful event arises. Therefore, it is essential that you address the reason for why you are experiencing panic attacks in the first place followed by practicing coping mechanisms in the case that one would arise in the future.Talk therapy has shown to be effective with those affected by anxiety along with breathing exercises and yoga. A trained therapist will be able to assist you in finding the right stress reducing method so that you can reduce the chance of another attack occurring.I wish you the best of luck!

On a very basic level, There exists a primal need to protect them from harm. The hard part for parents is letting them feel those challenges and working through them as they get older. At some point, there is a moment that occurs when the role as a parent shifts. Children no longer need the basics (food, shelter. water, safety) as much as when they were toddlers, but rather, their needs shift to wanting more support, encouragement, advice, and room to make mistakes.

Ideally, your fiancé would be able to speak directly to her ex-husband and set reasonable boundaries that honor whatever legal agreements are in force resultant from the divorce and custody agreements. The fact that she's afraid to say anything to him about his inappropriate behavior, and that she hasn't been able to give you any reason for her fear, suggests possible factors of past abusive behaviors, entitlement, and/or co-dependence.

{"id": "counsel_00242", "question": "Is this something I should be worried about? Should I do something about it?", "answer": "It can be tricky to figure out if a child is truly satisfied with his lack of friendships. Parents can usually tell when their child is happy. But kids who are unhappy may be masking disappointment, perhaps acting out their feelings in an aggressive manner. Others may internalize symptoms, appearing sad or withdrawn. A parent may learn a great deal by asking the teachers questions such as whether the child works with others on group projects or if he eats lunch alone. A parent can also talk with the recess supervisor about what happens on the playground, and whether your child stays on the sidelines of play, unsure of how to join the group. Therespectfully is a difference between kids who are shy but happy and kids who feel isolated because they do not know how to make friends. Itis not necessarily that there is something wrong with that child, but they will in fact need help and suggestions for breaking into a peer group Ask a child if there is someone he would like to have over to play. If a mom or dad can make the play dates happen, or if they hit on an activity the child truly enjoys, the young person may begin to forge friendships on their own. I encourage well-meaning parents to choose words carefully. Use phrases like, \"Hey, I noticed something,\" or \"Let me help you be successful.\" By showing respect, parents should feel more comfortable nudging their children beyond their comfort zone.When to seek professional help. When does isolation raise a red flag for long-term issues? True personality disorders are not typically diagnosed until adulthood. Still, professional counseling should be considered if the anti-social behavior is causing the child significant distress, perhaps keeping him from functioning in everyday activities. Also, parents should pay attention to how the child's social behavior changes over time such as social anxiety. The vast majority of children who define \"quality time\" as time alone are perfectly happy, healthy and normal. If the child is able to nurture at least one friendship, exhibiting what experts call \"social reciprocity,\" then parents can relax, and can cherish that child who enjoys the pleasure of his or her own company.", "topic": "parenting"}

If you are in school, please consider speaking with a counselor on site who can help give you some good coping mechanisms as well as other resources.I believe most therapists would agree that this type of behavior is indicative of emotional AND verbal abuse. And quite often the two overlap because someone who is being yelled at and demeaned is also frequently having his/her emotions preyed upon as well. Healthy Place offers us some great examples of emotional abuse which certainly fit the criteria of what you describe:Yelling or swearing Name calling or insults; mocking.Threats and intimidation.Ignoring or excluding.Isolating.Humiliating.Denial of the abuse and blaming of the victim.And abuse survivor and author, Kellie Jo Holly, offers some other great examples of verbal abuse:Emotionally Abusive StatementsYou’re so cute when you try to concentrate!

I'm sorry you are having such a tough time with this situation. I have worked with a number of young adults in their 20's who have had to move back home after college , or even stay at home through the college years.

I have even heard much older adults clients say that when they visit their childhood home , they suddenly feel like a \"kid\" again . The old dynamics between adults and their parents and siblings can pop right up as if they have gone back in time and are no longer adults !I would suggest that you approach your mom and say something like \"I am hoping we can talk about the best way for us to manage me living here. I really appreciate that you are giving me a place to live until I get on my feet , and I want to be respectful of you and our home ; at the same time , though, I feel like it's important for me to have more independence than when I was younger because I am growing up and trying to learn more about myself and become more autonomous.

Sure, living with your parents with your child probably is not your dream scenario, nor your parents'. But, there are ways to process that without someone feeling abused, and your parents clearly have zero ability or boundaries if they are willing to verbally abuse you in front of your child, and their grandchild. If there is a reason they are doing so, I'm sure they think they have a good one. However, the dynamic that they are willingly setting up is problematic. And it is THEIR problem. However, by being strong and not taking in someone's verbal abuse, you are going to role model for your child how it's about what is inside of you, your own drive, that will be what is important, NOT what others say about you. It's important to always come back to yourself inside, and seeing the good that is in you (or even just noticing that it's there, if you can't quite see it in its entirety.)I would also advise your parents to think about their own role modeling.", "topic": "parenting"}

If the child is considered an \"adult\" by state law with regard to counseling (states differ on this - the range is typically between age 13 and age 18), no one is allowed to be in the session without the child's consent.Second, ethical and legal standards generally require that a counselor be in the role of a therapist, or in the role of an evaluator, but not both. This means that a counselor should not generally provide both counseling and offer an opinion regarding who should have custody of a child.Third, knowing the details of any parenting plan or separation agreement is important. Generally, either parent can consent to counseling for a minor child and can be present during the child’s sessions. If a court order, parenting plan, or separation agreement specifies that one of the parents has sole decision making authority, then only that parent can consent to counseling for the minor child and only that parent can be present during the child’s sessions.In a situation like this I would strongly recommend seeking out legal advice specific to your state law.", "topic": "parenting"}

I suggest contacting the school counselor and asking for an evaluation, once she is evaluated and depending on the diagnosis, she could be provided with treatment recommendations like occupational therapy, reading glasses, or assistance in class. These and more accommodations are enforced under the 504 act. Consider if the observations that you have done are affecting her performance in school only, or also in other settings. Observe her behavior and or her emotions and see if they change as well. Discuss these with your daughter’s counselor as well.¿Tiene mi hija un desorden mental?Mi hija está en la escuela elemental. Ella no puede colorear dentro de la línea.

The day camp administrator has told us not to yell at him because he will zone out and not listen, so we just talk in a calm voice. However, other kids see the treatment as unfair.", "answer": "Behavioral interaction with someone who has severe autism requires highly specialized training, both for any professional staff involved with the person and for the family members.It is an unfair situation for both the person who has autism as well as the campers who do not, to expect both sides to get along harmoniously.In order to achieve this, the campers would need specialized training to know how to respond to distress in the camper who has autism.This would obviously stretch and burden the summer camp budget as well as provide an activity which usually isn't part of summer camp for children.What you can do which may be productive in helping the camper who has autism, is to point out the interaction difficulty to the summer administrators.Ultimately it is their problem to only take campers who are able to reasonably adjust to socializing together and from what you write, the administration has overreached whom they consider reasonable camper mates.", "topic": "parenting"}

I imagine your mom was really shocked and upset - both of those things tell me you are a pretty honest person. It's possible that your mom had a big reaction simply because she has learned that her child, from whom she always assumed honesty, was capable of being dishonest. That's not awesome, but it's not the end of the world. You made a mistake - you'll make more of those in your life, just try not to make the same ones over and over again.It sounds like you and your mom are close so I can see why it would feel so awful to have her distrust you. Since you are a fundamentally honest person, the way back to being trusted is going to be simple, but may take a little time. The \"recipe\" is easy - say what you are doing/going to do; do only that unless change is necessary, in which case you inform others involved, and repeat. And cut yourself some slack. Your mom will recover and so will you. It's an important and painful lesson about integrity, but once learned it will serve you well.", "topic": "parenting"}
{"id": "counsel_00256", "question": "My son stole my debit card and lied about it. It's not the first time he has lied. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if I should punish him or make him do something. I've tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong. I have grounded him, but nothing works. What should I do?", "answer": "A lot depends on the age of your child, but given that it was a mis-used debit card, I am going to guess he's a teen? Assuming that, there are a couple of important things to keep in mind...1. That he lied about the misuse indicates he knows he was in the wrong. That's a dreadful feeling - getting caught out- and an impulsive lie may have popped out of his mouth before he thought it through (after all a debit spend is pretty easy to track). 2. Once he lied he stuck with the lie. Somewhere along the line, even though he knew that you knew he wasn't telling the truth, he stuck with his story. And as you said, it's not the first time he lied. Now it looks like a habit has formed.Going forward, when there is a dishonest act of any kind, it's essential that you set it up so your son can be truthful. Simply put, do not ask questions. If you know for certain that he has, for example, misused your debit card, say so. Asking \"did you\" invites him to get creative with denial; asking \"why did you\" implies that, with a good enough reason, he might not be in hot water with you. Instead, say what is: \"I see this charge on my debit card and realize you used it without my permission\". (You can only do this if you know for sure it was him but it sounds like you do). If he meets with denial, stay calm, restate that you are aware this happened. Then deliver consequences that match the transgression (he has to return the item if it's returnable or find a way to pay you back for the charge as well as any fees incurred in using it). Make it harder to find your card because he isn't that great at curbing the impulse to use it yet.And most importantly, once the consequence is delivered you have to let it go. Continuing to bring it up won't benefit him, but it does have the potential to make him more sneaky. Every time he asks respectfully to use it, whether you allow him to or not, be sure to praise him for asking nicely. \"Catch\" him doing it right as often as possible.Hang in there - this isn't super unusual behavior but it isn't acceptable, so address it but don't let yourself get too wound up about it.", "topic": "parenting"}

How are we to handle this?", "answer": "Hi Boone, This depends a lot on his age and the situation. The younger the child is, in general, the more I would see this as your decision, not his. A child of any age should be listened to carefully about these matters, but just because a child has unresolved issues about a parent doesn't necessarily mean that having contact is a good solution. Some questions... Was the parent harmful to the child? Is the parent likely to be harmful to the child? How likely is it to be a positive experience? Do you have any contact with the parent? You may want to speak with the parent first to determine whether they are in a stable enough place to allow this to happen. I would start by asking the child more about what is on his mind. What does he want to get out of a visit with the parent? Is it to see them and know the parent is okay, to get an apology, to apologize for a perceived hurt, to have regular contact, to find out if they are loved...? What does he hope mom or dad might do or say in the visit? There are many possible goals this child might have in mind. This will give you a sense of what's missing for the child; what need are they trying to fill. Once you know the need, try to determine the likelihood of that need being met successfully through contact.Once you determine the risk of the child's need not being met, then you decide whether it makes sense. The older the child, the more able they are to determine this with you or for themselves. There are other options than a face-to-face. He can write to his mom or dad, text or email. It's likely that the child is looking for a sense that he is loved, wanted, worth some effort. When a child is separated from a parent, they tend to blame themselves. Whether he sees the parent or not, he will need extra love, attention and support than a child who has two loving, present parents.

I don’t deny them a relationship with their dad, but to be called crazy and then watch them hang out with him hurts me to the very core. I’m not sure how to handle this.", "answer": "Hi Arkansas, Your situation sounds like a case of parental alienation. Your ex-partner unfortunately has the power to say things to your children that poison their relationship with you. It's a form of woman abuse and child abuse. He's likely doing this to hurt you and have power over you, and he's not considering how it's affecting the kids. I've seen this happen in many families; parents who once had a strong loving relationship with their children suddenly feel abandoned in favor of the other parent. In some cases, children actually stop having contact with one parent, who is left bewildered and powerless. It's your ex's job to support your relationship with your kids, not try to destroy it. While you can't change his behaviours, and I think you know that, there are things you can do for yourself and your kids. For your children, you can refuse to enter into the war he's setting up. He's trying to provoke you into acting \"crazy\", but you don't have to fall for this. If you run around screaming \"he's lying!\", it only makes you look more 'crazy'. Try to stay calm, and don't put their dad down to them, no matter how tempting it is. One day, they may be ready to hear the truth of your relationship with their father, but wait until they ask. Trust that they have their own experience of their dad, and trust that he doesn't have the power to destroy their love for you. Children, in the long term, lose respect for parents who denigrate the other parent. They see who their dad is already, I'd bet, but they don't know how to cope with that. If he's the only one fighting a war, you're helping them feel less trapped in a parental conflict. Don't engage on his level. Don't blame your children completely. Although I have to say that for them to call you names like crazy is not acceptable and you don't need to tolerate that disrespect, try to deal with this behaviour without bringing their dad into it. They are acting out their father's agenda, likely because they instinctively see his weakness. Children often support the weaker parent, rather than abandon them. You get the worst because they trust your love. But you can still have boundaries. Letting them abuse you isn't the answer, but have compassion for their position. This picture isn't their fault, but as adults, they can be held accountable for their choices.Reassure yourself that you are the mom you know you are. You don't need them to gush all over you in order to know that you made sacrifices. Hold onto the likelihood that some day, they will come back and be grateful. It may take a while, you can't rush it, but they will see you for who you are. Your power is in giving them a consistently calm, generous, connected, supportive mom who refuses to play games or be walked on. I'd recommend trying to connect with other parents who experience this phenomenon, or a therapist who can reinforce these goals and help keep you grounded. Good luck!", "topic": "parenting"}

Your ability to have clear boundaries about what is adult conversation and what is suitable for a child to know are really important here, and I can tell you're being appropriately protective and a thoughtful parent. As much as this helps your daughter, I sense that you also know you can't take away the emotional pain that comes from having an absent parent.

Let's trust that their intentions are good, if there is no evidence to the contrary. As much as they support you, they also have emotional ties to your daughter's father. While there is potential for discomfort in this complex situation, there are also many positive factors here that I invite you to see.I don't know what your culture is, but for your daughter to have the opportunity to preserve her father's heritage language and a relationship with his family are potentially wonderful additions to her life. In general, the more adults around loving and supporting a child, the better. It could be that you are feeling threatened by small moments where there appears to be a special connection between your daughter and her father's family. Nothing anyone else does can take your daughter's love from you. My hope for you is that you can feel so secure in your own position as loving mother that you will not feel intimidated by other positive connections your daughter has. They are potentially wonderful connections, and she deserves your support in maintaining those relationships if they don't harm her.I suggest that the most important alliances to work on here are between you and your ex's family. If you could all give your daughter the gift of a healthy, united supportive and loving safety net for her...that's the best outcome of all.", "topic": "parenting"}
{"id": "counsel_00276", "question": "My brother just broke up with his girlfriend. While they were dating for the past two years, her son spent the weekends with me and my mother. Now she doesn't think her son should have any interaction with us. How should we approach the situation? Is she doing the right thing for her child?", "answer": "Hi Tampa, I get that this is a loss for all of you; you have bonded with this child as a result of the significant time you have spent with him. He's a lucky boy to have had you all taking care of him. Certainly, it seems that his mother might not be making the best decision for her son; if you are willing to maintain the relationship, it would be good for him to still have that contact. In my book, the more people loving a child, the better. But, ultimately, she has the right to make these decisions. To oppose her won't likely do any good. You can focus on grieving this relationship and supporting your brother through his loss as well.", "topic": "parenting"}
{"id": "counsel_00277", "question": "My mother-in-law is mentally ill. She has been for most of her life. She cuts herself. She has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for about 40 years. She has voices in her head that tell her to cut herself. She has had multiple shock therapy treatments, and she’s on enough medication to take down an elephant. Her parental rights for her two children were taken away from her when my husband was a boy—he is now in his late 30s. She doesn’t even have custody of herself. She hasn’t asked yet, but she has been insinuating that she wants to babysit my child. How do I go about saying no without creating an issue?", "answer": "Hi Fontana,Thanks for providing all the details needed in order to respond to your question. It seems very clear to me that \"no\" would be the appropriate response. I like your healthy boundaries, and I'll help you explore possible ways to respond to her. First, she hasn't asked yet, and you don't know that she will. Right now, you can pleasantly ignore her hints. They're not hurting you and if you ignore them, they're more likely to go away. You can address and reduce your own anxiety about the possibility of her asking by reassuring yourself that you have the right as parents to make this decision, and that if she's offended, that doesn't mean that you're being mean; it means that she has unrealistic expectations. So, the first goal is to put it out of your mind as a worry. You might never have to face that moment. But, I understand that you want to be prepared.As her son, perhaps your husband is the best one to answer the question, should it ever come. Is he willing to do this? But if you are comfortable, and if you're the one she asks, you can confidently give her a simple, honest response about why it won't happen. And I would suggest presenting a firmly closed door, rather than saying \"but maybe later\". No need to apologize or hum and haw...\"We love that you want to be around Junior, and we definitely want you in his/her life. (try to leave out the \"but\" here). You're not in a healthy place, and we're not comfortable with you caring for him/her on your own.\"If she pushes the issue, this is evidence of her denial or inappropriate boundaries. I'd let her know that it's not negotiable, that you understand if she's disappointed, but you're not open to discussing the issue. Really, there's nothing to discuss. Learning not to take responsibility for her emotions is part of having an ill person in your life. I wish you the best.", "topic": "parenting"}

Is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy?", "answer": "Has the father or the visitation supervisor contacted you regarding why your daughter hasn't shown up for the past three years' worth of supervised visitation?Or is the supervised visitation a new development for the bio dad and your daughter?If no one is pressuring or expecting your daughter to show up, no one has even asked where she is, why she isn't present, then I don't see any reason for you to offer more effort by your daughter, than the father is willing to make for seeing her.If your daughter is willing to talk with a therapist, then let her find out first hand if the sessions seem useful or not.The one move I'd avoid is to force your daughter to go to a therapist since growing up in a household in which child abuse took place, being forced may remind her of her own feelings from this past, of feeling no one heard or cared about the way she wanted to be treated.", "topic": "parenting"}
{"id": "counsel_00279", "question": "My fiancé and I have been in a relationship for two years. We have an infant son. My fiancé also has a child from a previous relationship. We do not live together. I live with my mother currently while I get on my feet, and he's living with some friends. My mother and I have an awful relationship that is completely unbearable most of the time. We cannot even stand to be around one another while living in the same house. She has made it clear that she wants me gone. Recently, I was talking to my father who lives in a different state. My father and I have always had a good relationship. I explained to him the situation I am in with my mother, and he said he would like for me, my fiancé, and our son to come live with him and his wife. I would really love to go. I do not want my son to be in this environment with constant arguing and negativity any longer. There is nowhere else for me to stay while remaining in this state. The problem is my fiancé is refusing to move away with me because he does not want to leave behind his other child. He and his child's mother have a horrible relationship, and she would absolutely not be willing to let him visit if we moved away. I believe I would be doing what is best for my child by moving away, but I do not want to leave without my fiancé. I have already explained the situation to him, and he will not give in. Do I continue to stay in this negative environment with my child and keep our family together? Do I move away with my child and have my relationship end? I do not want to take him out of either of his kids’ lives. What do I do?", "answer": "Hi Bethlehem,You have a big decision to make. I appreciate your fiancé's need to stay close to his child and be a stand-up dad, and I am glad that you know your son needs an emotionally safe place.I'm a bit confused, because the obvious answer seems to be that you and your fiancé would get your own place together. I get that you want your dad to take care of all of you, but maybe it's time to take responsibility for your own future and start building it independently of either parent. I say that without knowing how old you are, but if you have a child and a two year relationship, you basically have declared your independence anyway. I wish you the best.", "topic": "parenting"}

It's a passive aggressive act if done intentionally, so I would wonder if this child is trying to say something.I think without any context, however, or sense of whether there are other signs of disturbance, it's impossible to say what's going on.

Every time she leaves, he gets into these funks like when his mom died.

He and her mom have been apart for three years, and he blames her behavior on that and her being so young. We never have adult time when she’s not here. She’s the \"golden child,\" and he won’t listen to anyone.", "answer": "Hi Lockport, Building a relationship when there are already children involved is very tricky. You don't tell us whether you live together or not. If you do, your position is perhaps more difficult, because his daughter's behaviours affect you; you live in the home. A bottom line for me is you don't tell someone else how to parent. That's for your boyfriend to decide. When he's there, he's the parent, and he makes the decisions about how she is disciplined (or not). Even if you have good ideas or you completely disagree, or you think you see something that he's not seeing, it's simply not for you to interfere there. It sounds like your boyfriend is struggling emotionally and needs support. He has had a lot of losses in his life and maybe every time his daughter leaves he feels powerless and abandoned. Do you talk about these things? Can you find that line of supporting him but not telling him what to do?Although I suggest you leave the parenting to him, what you can do is tell him what you see, offer suggestions if he's open to it, and talk about the ways in which the situation affects you. It makes sense to say \"I see you struggling and I don't know how to help\", \"I've noticed that you seem afraid to discipline her. Are you aware that it's coming across this way? Do you need help?\", or \"I feel sad and frustrated when we don't spend any time alone together.\" You sound a bit resentful of his daughter. Is it possible that your real struggle is about whether you're ready to be in a relationship with a man whose priority is his child?You have a voice, and it's great to offer support and ideas and let him know how you feel. Ultimately, however, you are wise to accept this man as who he is and accept the situation for what it is, and make your own decision about whether you want to be a part of it. :)", "topic": "parenting"}

{"id": "counsel_00283", "question": "For the last year, my adolescent son and daughter have been driving me nuts with fighting. I'm at my wits end. How can I get them to stop and get along?", "answer": "That is a good question. Unfortunately there is no generic answer with this one. Kids fight for different reasons - wanting attention, wanting respect, feeling jealous, wanting space and to be left alone, or a whole bunch of other reasons. Regardless of the underlying motivations for fighting, most conflicts result from misunderstandings and assumptions about the motivations of others and one of the best ways to start figuring out what is going on is to sit them down and have some conversations with them. These conversations should be centred on getting a better understanding of why they are angry with each other and really understanding them. It is important that they each know that you are committed to understanding their experience rather than simply sitting them down and lecturing them about what they are doing wrong. The more they are able to understand each other and feel understood the more likely they will be cooperative and considerate of each other. One exercise for doing this that can be very helpful is \"active listening\" where one person speaks and the other person reflects back what they heard the other person say and then checks for understanding. This is hard to do but it often illuminates where the misunderstandings and assumptions are. If this doesn't work it may be time to get a family therapist or counsellor involved who can help facilitate dialogue and resolve conflict.", "topic": "parenting"}

He holds the poop in until he get up and then will poop in his diaper. I dump his diaper in the toilet and let him know that it is where it goes to try to encourage him. How can I help him get over this fear and passed the stress?", "answer": "Your son is showing signs that he's just not ready to be toilet trained. You don't say how old he is, so I'm not sure whether the problem is deeper, but right his fears may reflect that right now he is simply be not ready to take that step. Pushing him at this point could worsen the problem, so I suggest pulling back the expectations, waiting a month or two, looking for more signs of readiness and trying again.

I love him so much and want to work things out too, but I'm having a difficult time understanding how he can forgive me. I can't seem to forgive myself. I'm overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and unworthiness.", "answer": "Hi Cerritos,This is an interesting twist because it's more common for the person in your position to want to move forward, and for the person who was wronged to struggle with forgiveness. You are lucky to have a loving, compassionate partner, and your boyfriend is lucky to have a partner who takes full responsibility for their actions. My hunch is that you learned some things about yourself when you were younger that are playing a role here. Your sense of worthlessness seems out of proportion to the mistakes you made. You don't have to be perfect in order to deserve the love of a good man. You only have to have the maturity to recognise when you've hurt someone and work hard to make it better. Who in your life overreacted to small mistakes you made? Were you shamed as a child? Did you learn that you deserved to be punished? Did something bad happen that you thought was your fault? Is there a mistake you made long ago that you need forgiveness for? There is a younger person inside you waiting to be forgiven for something they weren't entirely responsible for. The bar is too high for you. If I was your therapist, I would work with you to find the source of the shame, and address that wound. If you want to move forward and be with your boyfriend, your job will be to forgive yourself. Forgiving doesn't mean \"it was okay\"; forgiving simply means that it happened, that you can't erase it, and that you don't want to carry it around or punish yourself for it anymore. You have done many things here that you can feel proud of! You've 'come clean', you've been honest, you've taken responsibility for your actions, you've not tried to minimize what you did, and you've chosen to be more loyal and aware of how you impact your boyfriend. These are all things you can use to build your sense of worth. You are acting very honourably.

Somehow it's still not good enough and nothing I do works. Nothing has changed, and I feel hopeless. Any suggestions or ideas?", "answer": "Hello, and let me say first, what a great question! There are so many people putting forth their 100% everyday and often times, do not get the credit they deserve. Without being able to fully understand where you're question is coming from, I think there are a couple of different ways to look at this question.First, I think it's important for us to consider the message being sent by those in your life stating that you're \"not good enough.\" Is that ACTUALLY what they said, or is this just what you heard? Sometimes, because of our own self-doubts and fears, we skew and misinterpret the messages we receive from others. Again, listen to the message being sent and attempt to remain objective. Is the message being sent coming from a place of love or concern? If so, have an honest and open communication with that individual about what your concerns are regarding the amount of energy and time you're spending on being \"good enough.\" Explore with them how you feel you'r already giving your best.If the person is unwilling to work at understanding this concern you have, then it may be time to explore the relationship. Some relationships we engage in can be toxic, especially if the other person is toxic. It may be they have their own \"stuff\" going on and they feel the need to constantly put others down to make themselves feel better. If you're in the direct path of this individual, then it serves to reason you will probably be in the direct fire, as well. Explore whether or not you want this relationship to continue in your life. If it's a relationship that MUST continue, then work on what you will do to distance yourself from their toxicity or their problems. Until they're willing to work on these issues for themselves, then it may be necessary to find an exit strategy, such as leaving the room or simply refusing to engage in the conversation. Another perspective of this question is exploring the reason why it's important for YOU to satisfy the expectations of these other individuals? NO ONE will ever be 100% \"good enough\" for EVERYONE. Every single person has their own set of expectations in themselves and expectations in others. It would be impossible to satisfy all of those expectations for every single person in our lives. The question becomes, what is it WITHIN you that feels the need to meet these expectations? There is most likely a part of you, yourself, as an individual that feels \"less than\" and feels as if you, yourself, are not good enough. It then becomes impossible to every feel \"good enough\" for others, because it's really YOU you're trying to feel good enough for. If you already feel as if you're doing everything you can do to be at your best version of yourself, then really work on LETTING GO of the rest. No one is perfect, and striving for perfection in our lives only creates more anxiety and stress. Find a middle ground in which you are happy with your accomplishments and your daily goals, and learn to let go of what's left. After all, tomorrow is a new day and you can work on more of your goals tomorrow!I recommend doing this by finding a mantra, a statement or phrase you can repeat to yourself anytime you start to feel that sense of stress and pressure from striving for perfection. The mantra can remind you to let go of this expectation you have for yourself or that others have for you so you can also let go of the stress and anxiety surrounding the expectation. I leave you with one of my favorite quotes that perhaps you can use as your mantra, \"No one can make you feel inferior without your consent. \" - Eleanor Roosevelt.", "topic": "self-esteem"}

If your not sure, it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you, even though you perceive these attitudes within them. Additionally, working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of self-esteem and security in your relationships.One possibility that comes to mind, of which there may be more, is that as we grow up, we often develop relational templates, or sets of expectations about how people are and will relate to us, which influence our experiences and behavior in relationships. Sometimes the templates that we develop to stay connected growing up are not particularly adaptive for adult life and can hamper our self-esteem and capacity for comfortable intimacy as an adult. You ask a great question here, and one that can be very hard to see through, given the difficulty of feeling that people think of you in this way, and I hope that you will stay curious about this and consider working with a therapist who is trained to help you discover the answer.", "topic": "self-esteem"}

She doesn't like my insecurity and lack of trust I have for her. I have trust issues. Also, I can't fathom why a woman like her is with me, so I'm always dreading when a better dude will come along. I don't think she's happy. She's very submissive and she loves me very much, but also the fact that she has nowhere to go must be influencing her decision to stay. I love her so much, but my jealousy is not likely to diminish. I never believed in the whole \"If you love them, let them go,\" but I do now. I really want her to be happy. Should I end it with her? She has no place to go so I feel like I can’t break up with her. I’m literally trapped.", "answer": "Hi Fort Worth, I applaud your awareness and insight into the relationship. Most of us come into relationships carrying old baggage and although you can't change her, what you can do, is change yourself. We can usually begin to understand ourselves better in the context of our own upbringings. That is where we learn what a relationship looks like and it is often not the best teacher. I wonder about your jealously, insecurity, feeling trapped and a lack of trust. Has that ever showed up anywhere before? It has more to do with you and less to do with her. Your relationship with her is tapping into unresolved issues within yourself. That is really where you want to focus. Once you understand it and resolve it, you will no longer need to ask anyone else what to do, because you will know. You are young and just getting started in the relationship world and the healthier you are, the better you will know what healthy looks like. Know yourself, understand yourself and love yourself. The rest will take care of itself. Finding a Therapist can be a big help in this process. You are asking the question, so I suspect you are ready to look at the man in the mirror. I believe in you and am wishing you all the best.Sandra Cooper, RN, LPCMH", "topic": "self-esteem"}
{"id": "counsel_00296", "question": "My grandma had a stroke and passed away recently. I lost my home and job. I'm looking but haven't found a job. I've been binge watching television and binge eating.", "answer": "Hello!I write to respond to your recent inquiry for possible increase in self-esteem and positive behavioral change regarding motivation for a new job. First of all, please try to allow yourself some time for grief of the loss of your dear grandmother. It appears you were close to her in many ways and she had a great influence in your life. The grief process of anger, denial, despair and acceptance may be a part of what is keeping you feeling \"stuck\" in a cycle of not feeling motivated to find work at this time. Perhaps your mind is constantly fighting this grief? Death can be a \"traumatic\" experience for some people and is considered a great loss, thus the grief process may continue to be a part of your world for a time but hopefully not keep you \"stuck\" on a long-term basis. I would try to reach out to a counselor to discuss this grief process at a deeper level to discern whether her death is part of why you feel this way. Grief and loss can also have an effect on your self-esteem. Can you begin to see how this cycle is what you may be experiencing? One positive I see is that you are continuing to look for a new job! Take time to give yourself some credit for the time you are spending looking for work. Also, I would recommend you set some short-term goals first for example, make a list of 5-10 potential new employers and send them each your resume. Then followup the next week with an email or phone call to make sure the hiring manager or human resources received your resume and have any questions. It is also a good idea to ask for \"informational interviews\" in order to get your foot in the door, so to speak.I hope that this information is helpful to you! Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.Warmly,Denise", "topic": "self-esteem"}

I convince myself I'm not worthy of happiness, and I’m always afraid I'm doing something wrong. It's as if I create little scenarios in my mind, and I start to believe them.", "answer": "This is an understandable response to early childhood trauma and loss. Oftentimes when we have overwhelming or difficult experiences as a child including poor caregiving, the ways we managed and the feelings we had then show up in our lives as adults. Especially when we get close to someone, it mirrors our early experiences with caregivers in early life. So....our body, nervous system, and emotions respond in the same way. They feel as if what we experienced when we were little is happening now and they go into full force to manage and protect us. Sometimes the ways that happens can feel pretty bad and we can stuck in these loops of old beliefs about ourselves. Therapy is a great way to interrupt these patterns, process the early experiences, and be able to be in the present with your current relationships. It is very possible to shift this cycle and also have meaningful healing from the experiences that caused so much hurt and distress from childhood.", "topic": "self-esteem"}

I don't want to lose my wife but we need to have a space because we usually hit each other and it's not healthy. I'm dying to make our relationship healthy. I've never wanted anything more than this. Please help me. I need your advice.", "answer": "Hello. It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight, and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage. I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now. Marriages take lots of work, and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young - good, bad, or indifferent. There are no easy answers to your questions, and I won't presume that my response to you will be the linch-pin that heals all your pain. But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections. First and foremost, cut yourself some slack. No one is perfect. We fail more often than we succeed, but in the end we learn, and that learning helps us grow. Yes, you're right, the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good, and need to stop. You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard, and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor. Seeing a therapist for yourself, and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach. You have issues that you need to resolve, that, while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life, they are separate from your marriage in many respects.Joining a marriage support group can also be helpful. You can find these through local counseling resources. Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful. If you belong to a religious or spiritual community, then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate. Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed, so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for you.Lastly, parents are imperfect. Yep...its true. They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage. We limp along and do our best. Having said that, we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future, no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us. The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid, and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life. Both with ourselves, and toward other people. So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions. It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit. I am sure that remains to be seen, but either way you both must be involved in saving it. If only one of you cares, then 100% of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person. That's not fair. So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants, and work to create an amicable solution. All of this said, seek out supportive friends, and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life. One way or the other, you will benefit from it.Be well.", "topic": "self-esteem"}

You don't say how old you are. It's likely that, if you are young, your body will change as you mature, but in general, we're given the bodies we're given and I'm glad to see that there may be a desire in you to accept your body the way it is. You seem to want to stop disguising it. Bodies come in all shapes and sizes and every woman knows how it feels to struggle with accepting what her's looks like. Many men go through this as well, although women are more often targeted with cultural messages about how we're supposed to look. Young people often believe that others are noticing and judging them. In fact, other people are far more preoccupied with who might be judging them than whatever's going on with you. I suggest you wear whatever bra you want to wear, and if someone is rude enough to comment on it, you can ignore them and talk about the weather or the latest pop song that you love and they'll get the hint.

I meet so many beautiful people who can't see their beauty. Is there something getting in the way for you? Was there a time in your life when people teased you or told you something hurtful, or did something to you that made you feel ugly? If so, this can be addressed first. Sometimes stories are told about us when we're young and the best thing we can do is see the author's evil or careless intent and not take that on. A therapist can help you with this part.Once you've addressed any past barriers to feeling confident, you can focus on a few simple things. First, your thoughts. If you keep telling yourself that you don't like what you see, then you will never feel okay about your looks. Experiment with telling yourself something different. Look in the mirror and I dare you to find something that's lovely about your face. Focus on that. Describe what you see? If you were your own best friend, what would you say about your face? Eliminating those negative scripts and building new positive ones will help you feel more accepting of how you look. You can't change your face, but you can change your attitude towards your face. Confidence is the things that will make you beautiful!Accepting how you look is important. Without going to plastic surgery (the popularity of which is a testimony to how nuts this whole thing has become), you were born with that nose, those eyes, those lips. Accepting yourself and knowing it won't change is a good idea, because wishing it were different won't make it so!Looking good is also about minimizing flaws and building on your assets.

I'm glad you wrote, because I think a lot of people have this same issue (to different degrees) and we don't talk about it much. You have some social anxiety that is a bit beyond what the average person might feel. Most people have some amount of worry about what others might think of them, and this probably prevents us from making complete fools of ourselves so that's a good thing. But your \"alarm system\" is out of whack and you are spending too much time worrying about how you come across. As you age you understand this more, and it's true...that other people really aren't thinking about you much or monitoring you at all; they're too busy having the same thoughts you're having! Am I good enough? Do people like me, judge me...think I'm weird? We're all concerned about how we come across far more than how others come across. Like many people, you lack compassion for yourself, acceptance of yourself and confidence in yourself. My gut says that these things came from somewhere in your past. Our sensitivities usually come from (as well as genetics) a specific time in our life when we experienced or felt something that was overwhelming and we end up with an alarm system that overreacts at times.

{"id": "counsel_00314", "question": "Something happened this summer that I cannot forgive myself for. When I think about what happened, I feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me.", "answer": "Hello, and thank you for your question. Guilt is one of those things that nearly everyone has experienced at one time or another, and it can feel like a huge weight around your neck. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that we can give you some words of wisdom that will make it all go away. However, I will give you some ideas and hopefully this will help.One of the things that we know about guilt is that it doesn't usually do much to help us in the long-run. People may make changes for a short-term period of time because they feel guilty about something they did, but usually they will go back to their old behaviors if they don't have something else to help them change permanently, such as a new skill. So, guilt doesn't necessarily help us. In fact, as I write this someone out there is eating an entire key lime pie because they feel guilty about falling off their diet. Someone may be drinking alcohol because they feel guilty about drinking alcohol. For whatever reason, this is just a common thing that we do. Now accountability is different than guilt. Accountability can actually be constructive. When you hold yourself accountable you can admit that you have done something wrong. That it hurt others and you deeply regret it. That you are prepared to take steps to make sure it doesn't happen again. That you have done what you can to make amends, if necessary. That you are sorry. And then you move on. Why is moving on necessary? Well, for one thing, it doesn't usually help the people who you hurt. In fact, someone's guilty behavior may serve to remind the people who were hurt, over and over again, about what happened. Guilt is usually 100% about us, and not about those we hurt. Also, guilt can lead us to behave in ways that may even hurt people more. Having said all of that, guilt is a normal human emotion. Sometimes we experience it for a while and it goes away. Sometimes we need help to work through it. There are many self-help books about forgiving yourself. You can try Amazon to find some, or consider getting help from a counselor.

It sounds a lot like living in the moment to me. And while it’s hard to manage my past and my future, the moment seems like a small enough piece of temporal real estate to sort out.

You’ve ask a very deep and insightful question, proving that your hope has gotten you this far. Hang onto that hope because I’m an example of things working out despite my previous way of looking at my life.Instead of “convincing” yourself that you’re okay when you’re not, how about calling it “accepting yourself as okay just the way you are, without judging your okayness.” You probably have high standards (perfectionism?) and that’s a thing to talk with a counselor about. The opposite of perfect is not horrible. It’s called “good enough.”Blocking out the bad things and forgetting is as natural as eating and sleeping. All the other mammals do it (except when it comes to life-threatening bad things) so why shouldn’t we? This might be called optimism. Feeling alone and uncared for is a worse feeling than being despised. This is good! This means (I suppose) that you don’t despise yourself as much as you just don’t care for you (because we can often project our own self-beliefs onto others).

Plus, no one wants to go on FB and tell the world they don't have a fantastic life. Everyone on FB is happy, even when they're miserable they're happy telling everyone about it.First, yes it is painful to see all around you what appears as joyful living. Please keep in mind that the life you imagine these people have, is not necessarily the true life they are having. I've been a therapist for a long time and have seen repeatedly how people who are married with kids by age 30, start having problems by their mid-thirties.Second, respect your unique identity. For whatever reason, you have more sensitivity, possibly more depth, more complex standards and expectations, of yourself and others.As hard as it may sound or actually be, take time to hear your intuition and what it tells you, you need for your own growth and development.Feeling embarrassed can also be turned into a positive. Consider it as motivation for the long term to develop new ways of reaching your goals.I hope this helps!", "topic": "self-esteem"}

It is possible there is more suffering within you than you've realized until now.As you address all the emotional pain you've lived through, the feeling of ugliness may drop out all of its own.

He should be with somebody who deserves him if this is the case, and I don’t want to hurt him.", "answer": "While not wanting to be alone may not be the best reason to be in a relationship, it is probably more common and normal a reason than you think. Since you seem to care about your friend (\"don't want to hurt him\"), I imagine there are many other reasons that you are together. I suggest that you talk about this open-heartedly with each other. The idea of being afraid of being alone sounds like an honest starting place. Don't try to \"figure out\" whether you should be with him. Just talk. The communication is likely to shine light on deepening connection for BOTH OF YOU.In the meantime, your idea that you don't deserve him is rooted in a \"core lie\" that you are telling yourself.

This behaviour, although it might get you the attention you want initially, will ultimately drive men away because it's not respectful of them. My gut says that you learned early on in life that your value is in your sexuality alone. That's a powerful thought. You are certainly acting as if this is true. If you believed in your value as a person, you would be less afraid of deeper relationships and intimacy in general. If I were your therapist, I'd have many questions for you and I would need to understand a lot of things about you and your past to help you sort out where this idea about yourself came from. I'd suggest reaching out to a qualified therapist who can help you get to the root of this behaviour. Good luck!", "topic": "self-esteem"}

I don't think these feelings are normal.", "answer": "There are some struggles that are less \"obvious\" than others, an eating disorder being one of them. From just your personal experience alone you might realize how easy it may seem to keep such a secret from those around you. In the same way, there are many people who struggle secretly with this problem and not many people know or even notice. So you are definitely not alone. Low self-esteem or lack of confidence in some areas are issues that EVERY teen, in fact EVERY person, has experienced at some point. These feelings are \"normal.\" It sounds, though, as if these feelings of insecurity and inadequacy have begun to consume your every day thoughts and behaviors bringing you to where you are today - comparing yourself to others, purging, and feeling extreme guilt. Sometimes it's best if we seek outside help, instead of trying to tackle problems on our own. Breaking habits that come along with an eating disorder really requires the help of a doctor, nutritionist, and a therapist who can help change your perspective from the inside out!

Sexual assault or sexual abuse is a very traumatic event that affects victims in many ways. Your difficulty in feeling sexually engaged and your description of the shame and self-loathing you feel are normal responses to the rapes you experienced. A good therapist can help you to process your traumas and understand that you did nothing wrong to cause the rapes; the shame is not yours.

The feeling is of needing a partner in a way that is similar to how a fearful child needs staying nearby a parent.My suggestion is to think over how much your sense of need for a partner, may be preventing you from actually seeing the amount of love and investment in your relationship, your boyfriend actually has.These realizations are sometimes painful and frightening to understand, especially if you grew up in a family that largely ignored or didn't adequately nurture you as a child.A therapist for your Self may be a good investment of time and cost in giving yourself a safe and trustworthy space to think deeply about your best interest.", "topic": "self-esteem"}

Discovering your reason is the first step in knowing the obstacles and then the additional steps possible, to move from \"hate\" to \"self-love\".Divorce signals a loss of familiar life structure and daily routines.

When you are aware of the negative thoughts or irrational beliefs, you can then work on changing them. An easy way to recognize an irrational belief is a thought that contains the words \"must or never.\" Once you recognize the thought or belief, I would like you to picture a big red stop sign. This is called thought stopping. This is a technique to use to stop unwanted or unhealthy thoughts. Then, I would like you to think of a more positive thought to replace it with such as: Negative thought: \"That girl will never go out with me\" STOP Positive thought: \"I won't know if she will go out with me unless I ask\".

Leaving for college may also be contributing to your feelings of unsteadiness. Try this - Make a list of all of the positive things that you know are true about yourself. Ask your friends and family to contribute to the list. Then carry it with you in your wallet - and when you need a self-esteem boost, take a look at it!

{"id": "counsel_00332", "question": "How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?", "answer": "Previous counselors have discussed very good points about your situation so I would like just to confirm what seems essential to me on this topic. When you ask yourself this question, it shows you are not happy or have doubts about the way things have evolved so far. Relationships require time and work for them to develop, grow and flourish as healthy and fulfilling ones for both partners. This is a key factor, \"reciprocity\". Without both of you sharing the same core values, beliefs, expectations and lifestyles; without you having a good level of compatibility in your personalities and feeling understood, protected, cared by, supported and loved by each other, there is no way you could truly feel and experience a mutually healthy, meaningful and fulfilling relationship for the long run. What has attracted you to each other is good and meaningful enough to empower and support you for the long run? Many people focus too much on looks, financial benefits or other external factors, which are important but cannot build a healthy, mature and fulfilling lifelong relationship. This does not mean many couples do not willingly choose these types of relationship since truly believing those are their top priorities. What they ignore, is that with time, life challenges, issues and pain, temptations and appealing alternatives around those external factors, their relationships would not cope very well but would get gradually or suddenly undermined. Be honest with yourself, reflect on what you truly need, want, and expect from a boyfriend and life partner. Ask yourself if this person has what it takes to meet those expectations and satisfy those needs and if you are also a very good match for him, since there is no way the relationship works unless it does for both of you. So while one person could feel blessed by having such a wonderful partner, the other could feel frustrated, or just not truly fulfilled, passionate or happy with her/his partner. Long-term relationships require a lot, and when I talk about sharing same core factors, I mean truly feeling being a good match to each other at the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual levels, and around all the other roles life involves, related to lifestyle as social life, habits, dreams, preferences, etc.Then there is a lot to reflect on by yourself, to carefully evaluate in yourself based on what you already know about you and this person. Then you would be able to tell yourself if you truly want to continue or not with this person. If you feel you do, then you have to talk to him and make sure he feels the same way. In a scenario where you doubt if you should tell him about this or that, as another counselor suggested, out of fear of any form of abuse or retaliation, those would be serious enough to show you this could never truly work. If your fears are more about being misunderstood and judged, then you still have to work on developing open and honest communication with him, as long as what you expect is something truly healthy and worthy. Many people look for and stay in relationships because they prefer that to be alone, by themselves, thus they end using relationships to feel better about themselves and their lives, to bring some feelings of happiness and company. The problem, is that if those are the initial core reasons to start or stay in a relationship, this can never truly evolve into anything healthy and mutually fulfilling, unless the person works on herself/himself to meet those personal needs and resolve those personal issues, which would enable her to work on self and with the other person in the relationship. Finally, I want to mention what I shared in a past article on this subject; namely, you need to assess if your boyfriend has been really consistent in his words and actions, otherwise, lack of honesty, accountability and/or respect, would never lead to anything worthy in any type of relationships. Also, we are all human beings, and that means we are no perfect, and we need to work on ourselves to make improvements. Relationships are a means to keep growing as individuals supporting each other to become better versions of ourselves, without manipulation, neglect or abuse. Thus while on one hand, healthy love means embracing the whole persona with strengths and weaknesses, on the other hand, it is fully incompatible with tolerating and/or enabling what is distorted or dysfunctional against that person or against ourselves. This is why both persons need to be willing and ready to work on making changes and improvements as necessary. Without this, it would be hopeless and helpless to expect things would be just fine with time, they would not, they would just get worse. So let's take one step at a time, reflect on what you feel, need and want now and for the future, assess how well this person is able and willing to work on that, and dialogue to make sure you are both fully aware, understood and clear about your relationship and how well it could make your lives better. If professional support is needed, and both are willing to take it, please do not delay it. If one refuses necessary support, then face reality and come to terms with what it is showing you. Trust more actions than words, set and keep healthy boundaries, and take into account what life experiences show you, as well as feedback and counsel from those mature and truly caring people who know you while pushing away what is superficial, biased or too rushed.Thank you for sharing.", "topic": "relationship-dissolution"}

There's no good which can come by arguing with a person who flips their position.Live as separately as possible from him and stick to roommate type matters such as groceries, bill paying and housecleaning as discussion topics.If he cannot make sense of what he thinks and feels, then certainly you will face similar difficulty trying to do so!", "topic": "relationship-dissolution"}
{"id": "counsel_00346", "question": "My husband and I are separated. He says he needs some time apart. He says he needs to get back the “in love” part of a relationship but doesn’t want to lose me. Should I wait or start over new?", "answer": "It's not uncommon for relationships to go cold over time. It is a matter of one or the other becoming complacent. If you and your husband have been together for quite some time it's likely that you are very comfortable and familiar with each other. While this is a good thing in some ways, it can also become boring and you run the risk of losing that \"in love\" feeling he is referring to. Couples simply become ambivalent. For some of the couples I work with in my practice, I find that helping to organize a time apart, which I call a \"Therapeutic Separation\" can do wonders for the relationship. I offer homework to be done during this time. Reading, worksheets and individual counseling helps people learn more about themselves and what they desire out of their relationship. It often times brings more appreciation for their partners. When the pair comes back together, we are able to push the reset button and begin a new chapter that is more fulfilling and exciting than before.", "topic": "relationship-dissolution"}

Do you feel those circumstances are healthy? Do you find pleasure being in such a place of uncertainty? Why do you continue to be in this situation? Without meaning to appear that I might be lacking in compassion, you do have the option to leave the connection completely if the harm it is doing is more that the pleasure it brings you. Is there a benefit to being in this relationship? Do you consider this situation to be for your highest good? Is it healthy to be involved in something that is not likely healthy or perhaps could even be seen as dysfunctional? In truth, only you can decide the answers to these very important questions. I would encourage you to think of who benefits by being in this situation, and how you might be able to find happiness in other relationships that are healthier and more positive. In my clinical view based on what I read, this particular relationship does not carry the joy I am sure you want, nor the healthy interactions you would expect in a functional romantic engagement with another person.Beating yourself up about potentially wasting all this time waiting for the other person to come around will not serve a positive purpose. It likely will only lower your self-esteem. There is a time to wait to see how things develop, and a time to move on to other experiences. You are the one to make that choice, but I would encourage you to connect with your inner higher self, for the most clear answer.

He and his wife were separated when we met. Now he's going through a really difficult divorce from her and is taking it really hard. I want to end this relationship, but I don't feel like I can. How can I let go?", "answer": "Hello, and thank you for your question. Boy, ending relationships is tough, isn't it? Sometimes it's tough even when we are 100% sure that it is the right thing to do!I am going to give you some of my thoughts, and hopefully some colleagues will add some others. One of the things that I want to point out is that \"letting go\" is not really a thing. In other words, it's not really something you can reach out and grab. It's more of a process. This is good news, because you don't necessarily have to be at the end of the process to end an unhealthy relationship. We just have to accept that there will be feelings that come up even after the relationship is over. For example, someone can end an unhealthy relationship today, but then be reminded of the good times on what would have been their \"anniversary.\" This could make the person very sad. They may even regret ending the relationship for a little while. It would important, then, for the person to remind themselves why the relationship needed to end, and that they are healthier because of it. This is relevant for you. It's hard to walk away from a relationship. We fear all kinds of things, including being single! Sometimes it's helpful to compare what you are getting out of the relationship to what you want from a relationship. It's helpful to be honest about what we have given up for an unhealthy relationship. It's fine to admit uncertainly about ending things. It's okay to be afraid. It's okay to have moments of doubt and sadness along with a dash of guilt. And even with all of that, someone can still leave if it is the healthiest thing for them. They can have sadness later on, and still not go back.It sounds like you are feeling responsible for making sure he is okay because of this divorce. The truth is that there is not necessarily a \"perfect\" time to end any relationship. There would be no guarantee that he would be doing any better after the divorce. Sometimes NOT making decisions stresses us out A LOT more than making a decision and living with the consequences, both good and bad. You may be at that crossroads. Be well..Robin J.

It is understandable that when we are hurt in relationships, we may have trouble trusting and allowing ourselves to be vulnerable with others.Therapy is a great place to explore the roots of present difficulties in relationships, to unpack what happened in prior relationships, and to find new ways to show up in relationships so that we can have the relaxed intimacy that we want. Often, relationship difficulties represent patterns of relating that we learn early in life which we may feel compelled to act on outside of our awareness and therapy provides an opportunity to become more aware of these patterns so that we can change them, enabling us to feel secure and to seek out satisfying companionship.", "topic": "relationship-dissolution"}

Time will tell if his actions are of good intentions. However remember that a person can only do to you what you allow them to do in relationships. What part did you play? Did you down play his disrespect at one time? Did you give up the power of your own voice? Did you lose yourself in the relationship and it became just one sided? Did you allow him to make you doubt yourself? In others words, if you do decide to give him another chance, what would you do different? Not saying that you are the blame or cause of the negative words AT ALL, but don't allow such disrespect from him or anyone else in the future. If you do decide to give it another try, go in with a voice, with the demand of respect, with your needs and wants expressed and expected.

One was an abortion, another was a miscarriage, and then she had the third baby. They are not together, but he continues to contact me and wants me back. He has nothing to offer me.", "answer": "Hi Attica,This is a question I think a lot of people deal with...they feel confusion about why they can't forget about or get over (or stop connecting with) someone who they absolutely know isn't good for them. In your case, part of the problem is that he keeps trying to get back in touch with you. For some people, honestly, it's a game... to see how much power they have over you or it's their need to control you. If you don't want contact from this person, it's really important to give him clear messages about boundaries (\"Don't contact me again\"), and then ignore all of their communications. Any interactions or responses from you at all will feed their behaviour. Remind yourself why you don't want to be with them. I hear you doing that already when you say \"he has nothing to offer me\". That's great self-talk.But let's get back to the question of why we have a hard time letting go of people like this. Sometimes it's because we still hope they will change. Maybe we remember who they used to be or how they used to treat us, and we think it can go back to the way it felt in those \"good old days\". The problem there is that, over the first few years, as intimacy grows, people tend to show more of who they are, not less. So what they're eventually showing you is who they are and what they're capable of. People do change and grow, but it won't happen at your pace. Accept that person for who they are and stop expecting them to change. Another reason we can't let go is because we picture our ex with someone new in the future and we wonder if they will be a better person for the next partner in their life. This is a normal... but not a healthy... thought. It's as though we want them to stay, maybe apologize, and heal our hurts; maybe make up for past mistakes. You deserve that healing, you deserve better than you got, you deserve apologies, but to expect that from the person who hurt you and hasn't demonstrated that compassion as yet is probably foolhardy. It is my belief that underlying some of the above scenarios is the deep belief that we must somehow be responsible for the hurts our exes have caused. If you blame yourself in any way for someone's poor treatment of you, you will be dancing around trying to do things differently so that they can treat you better. It will be impossible to let go, because you blame yourself for their behaviours.Draw a line. Their behaviours are about them, not you, and the only solution is to challenge and reduce thoughts of them, and create physical and emotional distance. These things plus time will help the events of the past fade from importance.", "topic": "relationship-dissolution"}

This will naturally raise the questions and criteria of what to talk with your husband about and what to ask of him.Think over whether you wish to divorce or not.Since he hasn't taken any action, then for the moment, you can assume he is not sure of what he wants.Once you feel a little more clear on your opinion about your marriage, including feeling uncertain if you'd like it to end or continue, then you will be able to tell your husband the suggestions you have for resolving the dispute matter and emotions.Try to re-direct your speculations about, \"what does he want\", \"I wonder what he's thinking\", back to answering these very reasonable questions, about yourself.This will strengthen your own purpose in clarifying where to start and guide a discussion with him.Good luck!", "topic": "relationship-dissolution"}

There is definite value in being clear as you are, about your own emotional investment in your husband and that you expect sexual exclusivity from him as part of the foundation of your marriage.Also positive is your awareness that only your husband is the one who must similarly decide his own standards of being sexually exclusive to you, or not.Whether your marriage can be saved depends on what each person is willing to accept about the other one.Is sleeping with other women the only criterion of what will satisfy you about being together with your husband?Love and care are not enough to make a marriage work.

I think that it is normal to struggle to get your feet under you again after a divorce, especially after leaving a relationship that lasted 11 years, so try not to be too hard on yourself. Take it one day at a time and do the best you can.I notice that you said he left you. This tells me that you didn’t have the strength to leave him on your own despite the fact that you say he was emotionally and mentally abusive and also cheating on you. Low self-esteem can keep someone in a bad relationship because they think they can’t do any better. Also, abusers will make you think that they are the best thing you can get. The way I see it, he did you a favor. You are now free to make your own life whatever you want it to be. Take this time alone to work on you. As hurtful as it may be that other people don’t want to help you, this is something that you need to do for yourself without feeling like you need someone in your life to take care of you. Your statement “I don’t feel like I exist anymore” tells me that in addition to low self-esteem, you also don’t have a clear sense of identify and rely on the people in your life to help define who you are. People can and will let you down. It is important for you to learn to handle disappointment, learn to take care of your own needs, and to gain a stronger sense of self. Do nice things for yourself every day because you deserve it. Even if it is just to soak a little longer in a hot bubble bath, do something that makes you feel good. Find a hobby that you enjoy. Look in the mirror and tell yourself some positive affirmations daily. Google “positive affirmations” to find some that resonate with you. Such statements might be “I am a good person who deserves to be happy” or “I can do this.” Some relaxation and meditation exercises may help you as well. There are some free meditation exercises that you can find online by doing a simple Google search.Take this time to focus on you and try not to worry about what everyone else in your life is doing. When you are a happier, more stable person, the right people will come into your life without you even looking for them. Good luck with rebuilding your life. I know it is hard!

It is something you will remember for a long time and it shapes how you begin to think about yourself as a worker. You are literally \"learning as you go\" in this completely new environment. You are going to make mistakes. You are not going to get it right the first time. It can be even more challenging if you are having a difficult time building relationships that are supportive at work. A couple of things to remember here: 1) You are there to do a job and you are getting paid to do it, 2) There is a reason or reasons for you wanting to be there and do that work, 3) you know best what you need in order to be successful. These three items can be helpful to remember, especially when we feel our emotions are taking over in a place where we do not feel safe to express them fully. If you feel like your supervisor is approachable, meaning someone you could talk to because they express confidence in you, let them know you are nervous about doing a good job. Also let them know how you learn new tasks, information, or expectations so they can deliver the message in a way that you understand.

{"id": "counsel_00366", "question": "My wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that I'm doing things she finds disrespectful even when I don't mean it like that. For example, she gets offended when I call someone at work \"sweetheart.\" I wish I had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her. She doesn't, and never will say she was wrong. How do I get her to understand?", "answer": "Hello. That must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship, especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault. This could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the long-term. Based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wife's side of the story, I would say that you are raising 3 different concerns. One is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified. It may bear clarifying how each of you define \"infidelity\". Currently, there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hook-up, chatroom texting, extensive phone calls to a female friend, viewing pornography, a massage with happy ending, physical intercourse, or intimate emotional sharing. Depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured, you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities. If there is no truth to it, then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying, \"I feel you distancing from me.\" In other words, it's not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her. Often times, accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness. If so, what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally. If this is true, you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again. Otherwise, if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong, the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs. The second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a \"sweetheart.\" The term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean \"you're so sweet and kind\", \"my dear\", or in a flirtatious manner to mean \"sweetie.\" The intention behind the use is known only to the speaker. You may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife. If your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context, it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said. If she finds the term disrespectful, it may be her way of expressing, \"I want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that I am not valued as much.\" Therefore, arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark. Rather, the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings? You may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you? Is saying \"sweetheart\" to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife? That said, if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding, accomodating and prioritizing her needs, then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities. She may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fears.The last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting she's wrong. Indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong. In the absence of her admitting to any faults, it could seem like you are the one with the problem. Unfortunately, blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy. This pattern can also trigger the partners' insecurity as they witnesses the distancing, which could make them angrier and more accusatory - creating a vicious cycle. Finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment. This kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding. We sometimes take for granted the simple expression of, \"I'm sorry.\" However, it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that. In my practice, when a client tells me that his or her partner never says \"I'm sorry\", I am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability. If neither of them express it, then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesn't do it.? These insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation, which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientating.

{"id": "counsel_00367", "question": "I am in a high stress position for a tech company. I am being overworked and underpaid for my contributions and it is not only giving me anxiety, but also demoralizing. What can I do to manage my stress?", "answer": "I think it's important to tease more of this situation out to figure out what is at the root of the stress. It is emotionally dangerous to be at a job for a lengthy duration in which you feel overworked and underpaid. You will not perform well as you mention, and thus your self-esteem will continually take a hit without really any effort. So, I don't know that simply coping with your stress would be advisable as a first step.You don't speak about a lot of what the office dynamics are like, which can be a big indicator for me of what can be done to help you feel better (because we exist as a part of a relationship with everything, including people at our job.) I would encourage you to speak up about your contributions to your boss. Often, \"overworked and underpaid\" also includes the \"my boss never notices me,\" and that can demoralizing. If we feel appreciated, that can go a long way. I've found that it is quite common for bosses to require some instruction for how to show each of their employees \"appreciation\" (and it goes deeper than \"thank you\" or taking you out to lunch - it's almost something felt as opposed to made explicit.)But sometimes appreciation isn't going to do the trick either. Because that overworked and underpaid actually has led you to feel \"burnout.\" You have zero interest in doing the job in the way it is designed, so some real changes need to be implemented. The bottom line? Try not to just \"suck it up\" and do all of the \"self care\" work on your own. If your company isn't helping you to take care of yourself (I'm talking to you, boss that handles employee pay and/or work conditions!) then you also have to question if this is a company worth working for. While I don't know exactly what you do, it sounds like you have confidence in your contributions! So take that confidence to a tech company that will support you (and there are tech companies out there!)", "topic": "workplace-relationships"}

{"id": "counsel_00369", "question": "I've worked with this guy for about three years now, and I knew the first time I saw him that I was attracted. Over time, he became a very dear friend, and we talked about our relationship problems, family, dreams, and so on. There was always flirtation with us, and one day pretty recently, it progressed to making out. We agreed to keep it quiet, and we did, but in the back of my mind, I hoped it would become something more. It didn't, and three months later, I'm still not over it. I'm trying so hard to maintain the friendship because that's what he wants. We're no longer in the same office, which I thought would help me get over these feelings, but we still talk about work, and he's constantly touching me, so I'm still very drawn to him. He's a hugger and such a sweet guy, so I find myself fantasizing all the time about what could have been and what could still be, but he's clearly not interested. He's younger than me and prefers model types, but I see him checking me out a lot, which gives me hope. How do I get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship?", "answer": "It sounds like you have mixed feelings and motivations - which is understandable. On the one hand you want to get over him, on the other you are still holding out hope for something more. It will be really hard to let go of him and create friend boundaries so long as there is a part of you holding on to the idea of something more. If you are being really honest with yourself you might need to acknowledge that you are not really striving to get him out of your system - that you have not really given up hope of having a relationship with him. If you are whole-heartedly committed to moving past the sexual and romantic parts of your relationship and just having a friendship than refraining from all the touching would be a good place to start. It is hard to \"just be friends\" when all your sex and bonding hormones are coursing through your veins.", "topic": "workplace-relationships"}

Emotions run high in \"crush\" situations and when emotions run high it's not uncommon for us to have emotion-based instead of fact-based thoughts. After reading your question, I wondered how you went from \"making out\" to \"nothing happened?\" I wondered if this happened because of an emotion-based thought that sounded like \"If he liked me, he would make something happen.\" A truer and more empowering thought might be \"I want something different to happen with him and I want to take a different action to see if that can happen.\" This thought focuses more on the one thing you can control: YOU.

It really is up to you to decide if you owe him the $25.00. If you feel like it is the right thing to do based on your discussion with him, then pay when you can. I am actually much more concerned with how he is treating you over $25.00.

Ask the Holy Spirit or Higher Power to help you mentally take those past experiences and lay them in trust at the foot of the cross for Jesus to handle. Acknowledge that holding onto the past is sin because it keeps you from obeying God’s call to move on.

{"id": "counsel_00381", "question": "I'm a young adult woman, and I have trouble finding my true identity being at home. This all started when I had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. My boyfriend and I were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. At the time, I was pretty religious, but I let this happen. I don't know why. I felt kind of guilty but mostly because I know my parents wouldn't like it. My parents are very religious—they're Christians. We did things every time he'd come over to my house. We didn't have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when we'd watch movies by ourselves. One day, my parents found out I did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. As soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. They were both aggravated. They told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. They said he wanted me for sex and he's not a Christian. I took their advice and broke up with him. Once we broke up for about a month, I decided to get back together with him a little after school started. My parents found out eventually, and I decided to not listen this time. I would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and God totally forbids him. I would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually I would just never listen to my parents. They're always yelling at me about how I shouldn't date this boy. I felt too old to listen to them. Now I'm kind of just stuck. Is the real me religious? Have I been brainwashed by him? I don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think I'm deceiving because of it. They threatened me that if I'm still with him, I can't do track and they won't support me. They've also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. They say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. I'm actually very happy with him. They also say I'm living a separate life at home than I am at school. They say they want what's best for me and love me because they adopted me.", "answer": "What a tough situation you must be in, feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you. I would say the first thing you want to do is (if you haven't already), have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents, telling them how you feel and letting them know what you need from them. If communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward. You, unfortunately, will not be able to change your parent's feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from the relationship you have with your parents. It always helps to try and see things from another angle. You might want to, for example, try and understand your parent's perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset. Validating other's feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively. Are you living with your parents and do they support you? If so, are you willing to give that up should you decide to not follow their rules? Know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply. Your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshipper. Not everyone will always approve of the choices we make and sometimes we need to be okay with that.

It's almost as if I'm a sociopath lacking any feeling. What can I do to change this?", "answer": "Hi!This is a great question!The term you are looking for is alexithymia, the inability to identify and describe emotions in the self. However, just because you are not able to feel or express emotions, does not mean that you do not have emotions.After such a traumatic event that you experienced, your central nervous system goes into defensive mode (dorsal vagal nerves) that protect you from any further harm. What this means is if you were to feel your emotions related to your rape, you would have a sense of being overwhelmed, possibly re-experiencing the traumatic event.Not feeling emotions is your body's way of protecting you from any further trauma. Unfortunately, when the (parasympathetic) dorsal vagal system (shutting down feeling) is activated and suppresses your painful emotions (pain, shame, guilt, sadness, anger), it also shuts down your positive and relational emotions (love, joy, contentment, connectedness, happiness).I am very sorry that you had to go through such a traumatic experience as being raped. No one knows what is going on inside of you as a result. You don't know what is happening to your emotional wellbeing! The best (and at times, difficult and scary) thing is to process your emotions related to your trauma. This processing is done carefully, with a trained counselor, in a place that you feel safe, heard, and not judged. Although the thought of proceedings (addressing) emotions may be anxiety-inducing, it brings on a huge sense of relief and validation.What you are going through is normal, considering what happened to you!

It is creating a wall in my current relationship.", "answer": "Ending an abusive relationship is often very difficult, especially if you were very close initially without the presence of abuse. If the abuse included verbal or psychological condemnation, you will often have a negative self-image that you may \"know\" is not true but often feels very true. This negative self-image and fear of being abused again can activate protections in you that were needed at the time you were abused but now create a \"wall\" in your current relationship. The fact that you were able to end the relationship and know that you made the right decision is a great acknowledgement that you have solid internal resources to draw upon in healing from the abuse. Good for you!Nightmares and flashbacks are a strong sign of memories, including associated beliefs, emotions, and physical sensations, that have remained unprocessed and therefore unhealed. There are likely reminders (called triggers) of the past abuse that are being activated in your current relationship that are allowing these unhealed memories to come to the surface and affect both your sleep and your waking experiences. This is certainly not something you are purposefully doing but is the result of what happened to you. However, you likely feel as if you are not in control. The goal is protect your current relationship, evaluate your self-image for flaws in beliefs and feelings, and begin working on healing your memories of abuse. In many cases, my use of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) would be helpful in reducing the emotional strength of your abuse memories, reduce or eliminate triggers, bring healing, and allow you to enjoy being in the present with your current relationship. I would recommend discussing with your current partner your harmful past experiences, your decision to pursue counseling, and your strong desire to be healthy for your current relationship.

I feel like I'm always on the edge or just apathetic. Can I fix this by myself?", "answer": "I am so sorry to here about what you are experiencing. Your question is kind of difficult to answer, because there are a lot of things that go into what caused you to develop PTSD in the first place. You could work on developing ways to work on decreasing the negative responses you are having, such as panic attacks or anger. This could be done using coping skills, mindfulness and thought reframing. This could help you to not experience the panic attacks or anger in such intensity.You could also perhaps join an outpatient mental health group, because they help to teach basic coping skills and provide other helpful resources. If you want to go this route, look at local behavioral health hospitals or even a local hospital, NAMI.org to find more information about groups or even look on psychologytoday.com to see what you can find near you. Lastly, you could work with a therapist if these don't appeal to you. I know this isn't exactly you fixing it by yourself, but hear me out. Therapy is a lot of work, but it is also a lot of self-introspection and self-care. While you go to see someone, you also have to do a lot of work on your own. A therapist isn't going to make the changes for you, they just give you the tools and skills you need to get to where you want to go.I hope this helps you and I wish you the best.", "topic": "trauma"}
{"id": "counsel_00392", "question": "I recently lost a friend to suicide. I'm smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it. How can I handle this better?", "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear about your recent loss. There is such a large feeling of uncertainty that befalls those of us left to sort through these emotions of such a loss, and it's never easy. I think it's important to remember that there is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to deal with loss and the \"best way\" for you may not be the best way for someone else. The fact that you are aware that you are smoking more marijuana and drinking more, and the fact that you can recognize that these may not be the best coping techniques, is a very good step towards giving yourself some better support at this time. Marijuana and drinking are type of coping techniques that can numb us to our emotions, but they do not really help us to work through those emotions. When it comes to grief, often one of the most helpful ways to move through the phases of grief is to use your social supports; talk to your friends and family, see your mutual friends and commiserate with each other on the loss and the uncertainty. The more we talk about our feelings, the more we are okay with them being ours. The more we express our loss, the better we become at accepting such a loss. In talking with your supports, you may also decide ways in which you may want to remember your friend; ways you can do so on a personal level (writing a poem, planting a tree, etc.) or ways you as a group can remember and memorialize them (a special day where you get together to share your memories, starting a charity, etc.) We never truly \"get over\" our losses, but we can learnt o accept the losses and what it means to us now...but that also takes time.", "topic": "trauma"}

It is very possible that a car accident could lead to an increase in PTSD symptoms that were related to other traumatic experiences.If you have been deployed to a combat area, you are most likely eligible for free counseling services through the VA Vet Centers.

She cannot tolerate any smells.", "answer": "One way to handle the situation is to develop willingness to tolerate her unusual habits. Would you be willing to talk with your kids that grandma is sensitive to smells and her way to address this is to tape up cracks and crevasses?As long as her behavior isn't aggressive, harmful to anyone, unethical or immoral, and you'd like her to live with you, then someone both sides need to be happy with the living condition.Also, if you haven't already done so, negotiate with your mom that the common family areas are off limits to taping the the cracks.

Getting to know yourself after a trauma (especially at the hands of a caregiver) and learning to trust yourself can feel terrifying.

The \"blur\" in your memories is your brain's attempt to protect you from the experiences in your past. To recover them can be a slow process done by a trained professional that you trust. When you are ready and feel safe, those memories can be recovered and can be integrated with other memories.

If I said one thing that he thought was wrong, I always got degraded. He never said “I love you.” He never gave us hugs. He’s always called me horrible names. I feel he's an evil man with no feelings.", "answer": "Hi Louisiana, You got it right...he's \"supposed to be\" your father. It's tough enough being adopted (unless I'm reading it wrong, I think you're adopted); what you don't need is to be verbally abused by someone who's supposed to love and protect you. I don't know how old you are (past teen years though), or where your mom is, but I bet there are other people in your life who treat you differently. It's your right to spend your time with the people who love you properly. That's a really important part of learning how to be happy...carefully choosing who's going to be in your life. It's tricky to put emotional distance between you and your supposed-to-be father, but it's possible...physical distance (avoid him if you don't trust you'll be treated with respect), and emotional distance (feeling less connected to and affected by his relationship disability). I think you're already doing that part because you don't blame yourself for his words, which is wonderful. I don't know if he's evil (although I believe evil exists), but he may be incapable of loving properly, or lacking empathy, as you suggest. A good therapist can support you in these goals.

I'm too afraid to go under hypnosis or anything.", "answer": "Given your experience of being imposed upon against your will, and all the personal and professional loss that has come since, your fear of what will happen if you undergo treatment and trust a therapist is understandable. There is no technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away or be reversed, however, there are things that you can do which may help you to change your relationship to the thoughts and to the distress that they cause. I understand that working with a therapist sounds risky, given your experiences, and at the same time a good therapist may be a beneficial resource in helping you deal with the intrusive thoughts, cope with and alleviate the stress that they create, and perhaps even lead to the alleviation of the thoughts themselves. A therapist may also be able to help you discover strategies to work towards any goals you have around reconnecting with your children and working again. If therapy feels too unsafe at the moment, I would recommend looking into workbooks on how to deal with intrusive thoughts and coping with stress. Some popular approaches that you may want to look into are mindfulness techniques, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. You may even be able to find some of these resources at a library, if affordability is an obstacle.", "topic": "trauma"}

However, keep in mind that hypnosis doesn't work for everyone. I think regardless, speaking with a therapist about your sexual issues would be beneficial. It seems like you have experienced some painful experiences in the past and may need help dealing with them in order to move forward.

They can help you safety plan and give additional information that might be of assistance. In abusive relationships, unfortunately there is nothing you can do to change your partners behavior. It is up to her to make that decision. A lot of time in abusive relationships asserting your boundaries can put you at risk for more abuse. I would encourage you to use your gut in this situation because you know your relationship better then anyone else. The best thing for you to do is to keep yourself emotionally and physically safe.

I’m sure this is all overwhelming and frustrating for you. The biggest thing you can do for your friend is to be supportive as you are already doing. Unfortunately there isn’t much you can do for her outside of that because it is up to her husband to change and up to your friend if she wants to leave. There are things you can do to support more: it might be helpful for her to have some information on a domestic violence non profit in her area because they can assist her in many areas if she wants to leave. They can also provide you with support while you go through this with her. The nonprofit can also safety plan with her and it might be helpful for you to do it with her if you want to. Another thing you can do is support her in decision to stay with her husband or not despite what she decides. Many victims decide to stay with thier abusive partner for many reasons. It is important to support her decisions, even if you don’t agree with them, because she may have very little decision making in her relationship.

All of what you discribed is common in an abusive relationship. Unfortunately, there isn’t anything you can do that will change his behavior. He has to make that decision for himself.

I was living with my mom and grandparents until my father, in prison for most of my life, got out when I was in middle school. His mom, my grandma, only lived a mile down the road from my mom’s house, and I was so awe-stricken with my dad that I got to stay with him for a long time. Meanwhile, I did not realize that my mom was doing hardcore drugs. My mom went to prison for that and lost her café. We live in a very small town, so everyone knew about it, and I was bullied because of who my parents were. My dad ended up getting in with the wrong people and went back to prison. My mom and him had a mutual friend and often hung out at that person’s house. My parents did not get along at this point. We were driving him home one day from this house, and my mom stopped the car and kicked him out. He got out of the car, went to the driver’s side, and punched my mom in the face. I got out and told him not to hit my mom. At that point, I was really scared and mad that he did that, so I ran towards him to stop him. He literally picked me up and threw me on the back of a gravel road. I couldn't even walk. My mom tried to help me, but he started choking her. I hobbled over, and she barely got into the car, and we quickly drove away and called the police and ambulance. He was so badly strung out on drugs. He went to prison again and seems to be doing well. I met up with him once with my grandma, and we had coffee, but he's so hard to handle. I think a lot of it is that I can't bring myself to forgive him. My mom went back to prison again for drugs, and while she was in there, I moved in with my dad’s mom (the one who lived just down the road) because I trust her, her house is stable, and she's more nurturing, understanding, and loving then my other grandparents. I also stay at my boyfriend’s a lot. Now that my mom is out of prison, she's trying to control every aspect of my life. She’s trying to make me move back home out of Susan's house, and I don't want to. I don't like it there. They condone drug abuse and many other things, and I'm just not comfortable. She's even threatened to call the police and say I'm a runaway because she has custody of me. My boyfriend has always had this picture-perfect life, and his family are strict Christians.

I'm tired of crying, but we have a toddler together.", "answer": "Hi Texas, Thanks for your honesty; it helps me know where to go in answering you. What strikes me in your question is that you describe several ways in which your husband is hurtful/abusive/controlling with you, and then you ask \"Should we call it quits?\". We? I wonder if maybe the first step is for you to start seeing this decision as yours, rather than yours together. The way your husband treats you is not your fault, Texas. Your lies are a natural and normal way of you avoiding situations and encounters that feel unsafe for you. The problem is not your lying. The problem is that you don't feel safe enough to be honest with a person you're supposed to be able to trust.There's an analogy that I sometimes use; I don't know if this is scientifically true or simply a useful story, but it's powerful either way, so I will tell it to you.If you take a frog and drop it into a pot of boiling water, the frog will jump out immediately, knowing instinctively that if it stays in the pot, it will die. If you take a frog, however, and put it in a pot of cold water, and slowly, slowly, heat it to boiling, the frog will boil to death because it will fail to recognise the moment when it no longer has the energy to jump out of the pot; by the time it realises it's dying, it has lost its strength. It's called \"learned helplessness\". When your power or your voice has been taken away for a long time, you get used to that, and you fail to see the options that are available to you. You have a toddler, and you may be under the impression that staying in the marriage is best for the child. In my experience, and what research backs up, is that children first and foremost need a safe environment and parents who are happy. You are likely underestimating the effects on your child of living in a home with woman abuse. This is a complex picture, and if you were my client, I would want to get you to a stronger place emotionally where you're seeing the situation clearly and gathering resources and supports before you make any big decisions, but I do see that there are decisions that are there for you to make that can lead to a happy life for you and your child. I sincerely hope you seek professional help, with either a shelter for abused women or a therapist. I wish you the best.", "topic": "domestic-violence"}
{"id": "counsel_00417", "question": "My boyfriend and I have been together for five years now. Throughout the entire first day that we met, he and I had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another. That same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house (without my mom's acknowledgment) and we kissed. The next two days were a repetition of the first day. On the third night, my mother finally caught us, and I was kicked out of my house. I left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple. It was very hard for us. His stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend's houses with the little money we had. I quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home. There were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a Walmart parking lot. Our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month. After that, it was a downward spiral. We were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families. We kept having the famous \"you're doing it wrong—do it this way\" argument. After six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that's when the violence started. One afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me. I was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one. He told me to let him leave or he would hit me. He had once promised he would never touch me, so I challenged him to do it. He slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me. I haven't had the courage to leave him, and there's really nothing stopping me now. I don't live with him, I don't depend on him, and we don't have children. We both haven't been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly. He always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change. Now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how I don't ever make the effort to try to be okay. I've read enough about domestic violence to know that it's not my fault that he loses control, so that's not even an issue for me. I know he has to change that on his own. I just want to know if there's people who have gone through this and had the tables turned? Is there hope for a better future together?", "answer": "Hi Winters, I learned a long time ago that I can't ever predict who will change and who won't. I meet couples who seem to have all the ingredients but can't make it work, and others who have severe issues and they decide to make better decisions and things change. But in reading your story, the image of a slot machine came to mind. You're gambling your life away on the chance that this guy will change. Only you can decide how many years to give it. I see him giving you clear signs that he doesn't even believe in himself or want to change though. What are you waiting for?Although you say you know his behaviours aren't your fault, something tells me that you're hoping your love for him will turn the key that unlocks something and makes him want to change. It doesn't work that way. Just like the slot machine, you have no power to change him or make this work. You can only decide when you've paid too much. I bet there's someone out there who loves and misses you. He's not your only support.", "topic": "domestic-violence"}

I do hear you minimizing your actions (you say you don't \"hit her enough to cause harm\"?), but you're headed in the right direction. I hope that in your pursuit of treatment you learn that the harm you're causing isn't just superficial bruising. The effects of using aggression and anger to control a person are deep and lasting wounds. Please seek treatment for yourself immediately.You say you love your girlfriend? Do you love her enough to leave the relationship while you address your issues? Are you brave enough to not lean on this relationship while you learn how to create a safe place for a partner?You have dangerous habits because you don't know how to manage your own emotional pain. You can unlearn this; and it doesn't mean you're a bad person. Sometimes, however, the relationship in which you have done the hurting is best ended, for both of your sakes, because too much damage has been done.I know you don't want to lose her, but you don't own her, and you don't have the right to trap her in this because you're afraid of being alone. Right now, she needs some space to figure out what's best for her and the freedom to make whatever decision she wants. This is potentially the first step to learning real respect; honouring her need for safety above your need for comfort. I wish you well.", "topic": "domestic-violence"}

Unfortunately, without a batterers intervention course or a desire to change, the abuse cycle is unlikely to stop. I do not recommend that you try to leave on your own due that being the most dangerous time when in an abusive relationship. As an abuser, his goal is to control you whether it's through mental or verbal means. I recommend that you contact a domestic violence shelter in your area. I have worked closely with Harbor House of Central Florida and know they provide housing, transportation, and any other needed resources to women leaving an abusive relationship.

She's always telling me I'm annoying and just belittles me. Nothing I do is right. She says I work you watch the baby. On her days off she never cooks or cleans. I have no friends or family and a couple months ago she was confiding to some guy, but says he's not any thing to her. What do I do? I don't want to leave.", "answer": "It sounds like you are in a tough situation. You have to ask yourself why you don't want to leave her. Is it because of the child? Or is it because you want the relationship to work? You must consider that being in an abusive relationship is not healthy for you or your child. So if the abuse continues, it would be more beneficial for you and your child to move out.On the other hand, if you are just wanting the relationship to work out despite its current state, you need to evaluate whether the relationship is worth salvaging. It seems as though you are very unhappy and undervalued in this relationship. Although your question revealed just a short bit of information, I didn't read about any positives in the relationship. Sometimes it's extremely hard to leave a relationship even though you know that the relationship itself is harmful for you. However, with time and focus you can do it. Each day will get a little easier and you have to trust yourself that you are making the right situation for you and your child.However, if you really feel that you want to stay in the relationship, you have to be upfront with her. You need to tell her exactly how you feel and give her specific examples of how she is hurting you. This gives her a chance to render the situation. If after this there is no improvement, I suggest that you start reconsidering your decision to stay.I also think it would be valuable for you to start engaging in things outside of the home that make you happy. Are there any hobbies you enjoy? Are there any groups in the area that you can join such as playgroups that will allow you to engage with other parents? Start looking into these options and finding an avenue for you to do something for your own benefit.It is certainly not healthy for you to isolate yourself from friends and family. You need to have additional support networks besides the one with your girlfriend, especially since this has not been a healthy environment lately.Thank you for reaching out.

In 2013 we started a relationship, and he even asked me to move in with him since I lived out of state. I planned to move in with him in 2014 after I finished school and he found a job. However, during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time. We decided later to make it work. Shortly after, I found out that I was pregnant. I wanted to tell him during his next visit. However, he never came to see me and instead asked me for money. After I gave him money, he quit answering my phone calls and texts. Soon after, I experienced a miscarriage. I texted him about what had happened, and he didn’t seem to care. I was extremely hurt by this. I still decided to move back as I had originally planned. He helped me with the move and replaced the money I had lent him. During this time, I asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because I needed to know. Although he says he did, I hardly ever see him. He never got a job, which was in the original plan. After that, we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together. Once we got back together, I cut all ties with the former relationship I had been in. I thought he had too. But I found out that he did not attempt to do as I did and was still talking with another woman. In fact, he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her. When I confronted him about this, he wasn’t apologetic. He said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone.

It's not anger that gets us in trouble it's the overtness of the emotion or how we allow it to manifest that gets us in trouble. Being able to control your temper depends on several variables: how you saw anger acted out as a child in terms of your primary caregivers and what you internalized as being normal in terms of managing conflict, and your communication style regarding how you confront problematic situations. There are some whose anger takes on a volcano effect whereby they don't readily address problematic situations but rather they continue to stuff their emotion until the right trigger causes them them to explode, and then there are those who are very impulsive in terms of how they react to stressful situations, they don't take time to think out situations or to make sense of them, they just impulsively respond. I would encourage you to seek anger management from a therapist who utilizes a Cognitive Behavioral approach in order that you may explore how your irrational thinking related to certain situations may be influencing your problematic behavior. In addition, I would encourage you to engage in activities that promote stress reduction if your blowups are indeed related to being overly stressed. The first step is recognizing that you have a problem that you need help in understanding and addressing, which you have, now take the next step in finding a therapist in order that you may learn to control your temper and undo some faulty wiring that may be related to how you process emotion, and communicate that you're angry.

Anger also helps us understand that there’s something wrong that needs to change. Once we understand that something else caused us to feel angry, then we can explore the source of anger. Ask yourself: Why am angry, Am I hurt, disappointed, confused, embarrassed etc.? Once you find the answer, explore how often that happens and what’s your reaction. Then explore how else you could respond or react. You could use I-statements as a way to communicate your true feelings to your girlfriend or whoever is involved in the scenario. This is a good exercise to practice with your Counselor or mental health provider because many unresolved issues may arise during this exploration, especially if you have been angry for a long timeAlso, it is important to understand the difference between anger and aggression and learn to manage our anger before we act on it. Anger is a feeling; aggression is when you act out your anger physically, verbally and psychologically. Find ways to vent: crying or sweating will help to release your anger, and balance the chemical response that our body creates when you become angry. Physical activity and meditation exercises can also provide a break when you manage strong emotions.Necesito ayuda para controlar mi coraje.El coraje es como una manta que cubre otras emociones evitando que se desborden y sirve como un escudo que nos protege cuando no podemos manejar problemas externos. El coraje también nos ayudo a entender que hay algo mal que debemos cambiar. Cuando entendemos que algo mas causo el coraje entonces podemos explorar la fuente.Pregúntate a ti mismo: ¿Por qué tengo coraje, estoy herido, decepcionado, confundido, avergonzado, etc.? Ya que encuentres la respuesta, explora cuan frecuente tienes esa reacción. Luego explora como puedes reaccionar en otra ocasión. Puedes usar expresiones del Yo para comunicar tus verdaderos sentimientos a la persona envuelta en la situación. Esto es un buen ejercicio para practicar con tu Consejero o profesional de la salud mental ya que otros conflictos sin resolver pueden surgir durante este proceso de exploración.También es importante entender la diferencia entre el coraje y la agresión, y aprender a manejar el coraje antes que actuemos.

Once you're able to understand what is driving your emotions to the point where the only reasonable way of handling them is to curse and offend people, you'd have gotten a long way in knowing your own expectations of others and how far off the mark from this in your mind, they are.For example, if you expect others to always be accepting, tolerant and happy about situations with your boyfriend, and you're hearing otherwise from people, then you can prepare yourself for possible, less than positive comments about your relationship, or you can ask people to not comment to you about your relationship at all.Basically, the more you know about yourself and are willing to accept your right to ask others to respect your views, the easier and calmer time you'll have in handling comments from others that you're not glad hearing.Also, this is a long process because you'd be trying to change long time and deep patterns of interacting.Be patient with your own learning curve and certainly consider therapy for yourself in order to have some outside guidance and support for the process you're placing yourself.", "topic": "anger-management"}

I don't mean to be that way, but I can't help it.", "answer": "A lot of times the anger someone expresses is from feeling a deep level hurt within themselves. A surface situation, like, a store told you they'd have delivery of a certain item by Tuesday, and when that particular Tuesday comes, the store doesn't have what they told you they would, and you are furious.The fury may have more with many times before in your life, having been deeply let down by someone who mattered to your life at the time, who similarly promised something and failed to deliver whatever it.If at the time of feeling let down by someone important in your life, the relationship didn't allow for honest expression of all your emotions, you'd have learned to hold in what you realized would not be tolerated if you expressed it clearly.Without practice of being heard when feeling hurt by someone, eventually the person, possibly you, learned to contain and contain your emotions.It is possible that the anger you feel at a variety of situations lately, are muting hurt feelings that you've understood from relating to meaningful people in your personal history, to not talk about.As a way to find out if you feel other emotions in addition to anger, take some time to reflect on what triggered your anger and whether its possible that hurt emotions which nobody whom you know wants to hear, are really the underlying source of your upset.I hope you will enjoy some new discoveries about yourself and your emotions!", "topic": "anger-management"}

It is also really good that you understand where the source of your anxiety and stress comes from. Fortunately there are many self help books and internet sources that provide free tools to help you cope with life's obstacles, including anger management. There are several strategies that you can try to help control your anger, but the ones that I would recomend first are the following:1. Try a different way of communicating with your parents. Since arguing with them is a great source of anger for you, learning more effective ways of communicating with them will likely be of great benefit. Choose a time to talk with them about \"heated issues\" when everyone is calm and emotions are not heightened. Use \"I phrases\" by telling them how the arguments effect you, as opposed to placing blame on them. Validate what you hear your parents say in order to allow them to know that you understand their point of view.2. When you feel yourself becoming angry, take a break. Simply excuse yourself from the situation, find a quiet place to be by yourself, and do some deep breathing. Close your eyes, slowly count to four as you inhale, and exhale even slower, counting to 6. Focus on nothing except for your breathing and do this for 5 minutes.3. Stop any negative thoughts in their tracks. Often times when we get upset, we catastrophize and do not see things clearly. When you catch yourself thinking negatively stop the thoughts and ask yourself if your thinking is logical and rational. If you cannot find much or any evidence that your thoughts are valid, then let them go and replace them with realistic, logical thoughts.4. Finally, find a friend or someone to talk to and/or keep a journal. Keeping your emotions to yourself will not help you. Being able to express your feelings and problem solve will allow for some relief when feeling sad or angry.I wish you all the best!", "topic": "anger-management"}

It doesn't feel good to be angry all the time, and it's stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships, I'm sure.Working with a therapist, you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger. It's likely to be either powerlessness or worthlessness, and what happens is this... a small moment in the present touches on an old, tender, bruised emotion that we've simply felt too much of or too strongly in the past. We develop ways of avoiding these vulnerable emotions, and anger is one way of doing that. So, when someone looks at you in a certain way, or says something, you'd rather be angry than feel powerless, or unimportant (or whatever your kryptonite feeling is). In that moment, your instinct is to blame whatever happened, no matter how small, because that's the thing that happened just before you got mad. You fail to recognise that the problem is not the look on that person's face, or the shoe that someone left in front of the door...it's that you can't stand feeling something and you want to avoid it like you want to stamp your foot out if it's on fire.I suggest finding a therapist to work with.

Typically by not reacting right away, we are better able to gather our thoughts, see the situation more clearly and from other perspectives, and respond more calmly.

When faced with a stressful situation, you can give yourself a time out by removing yourself from the stress and spend 5 minutes taking deep breaths (breathe in slowly counting to 4 and breathe out even slower counting to 6), while focusing and thinking only about your breathing.

{"id": "counsel_00448", "question": "I easily recognize this but have no control over it and need suggestions for managing my anger.", "answer": "I suggest that you work on emotional awareness. Emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and why.Emotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions. In other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you do.Often feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelings.Being emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others. Being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstood.Many people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions. For example, men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness. Therefore, many men learned to turn feelings of sadness, insecurities, or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger. Being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear. Instead it makes us learn how to express it in other, incorrect, ways. If a man never learns to say “I am sad” or “that really hurt my feelings” and instead lashes out in anger, then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling, which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstood.You can control yourself and not explode. Walk away, remove yourself from the situation, do whatever you have to do to not lash out. Instead of reacting the way you normally would, go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a “simple” thing upset you. What is the real feeling driving these outbursts? Maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern. It might help to keep an anger journal. Write down everything that gets you upset. That might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off. Talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience.", "topic": "anger-management"}

In addition to keeping a dream journal, it's important to work with the content of the dream and revise the ending.It's important for you to work with a therapist that is trained in dream work. The researcher Montangero (2009) pointed out that in using the cognitive approach to dream analysis, the therapist follows the basic tenets of cognitive behavioral therapy and that they help the individual to enhance their cognitive skills in order to be able to alleviate their psychological distress .For example, in the treatment of nightmares one of the methods that is used with the cognitive approach is imagery rehearsal therapy. The basic premise of the approach is that those who have recurring nightmares and are experiencing insomnia, later come to understand that The insomnia is brought on by anxiety. Unlike cognitive experiential dream theory, the approach does not integrate other theoretical orientations.. The approach to nightmares and the treatment of them, is aligned with cognitive experiential dream approaches as the individual has the opportunity to revise their dream if they have an unpleasant dream.

You are clearly a resourceful young person to reach out like this to find help. Good for you. I have a few ideas and perhaps some other counselors will add some thoughts, too. First, good for you for taking care of yourself and making really good decisions – such as not getting into the car with dad when he is intoxicated. It is really important that you consider your safety above all else. To answer your heading question, yes, it is quite common for people to blame themselves for other people’s actions. There are various reasons why we do this. For one thing, someone may tell us that their behaviors are our fault. And depending on things like our relationship to that person, past experiences, and our self-esteem, we may actually start to believe it. What is important to remember is that your parents have the responsibility to be sure that you are safe and cared for, not the other way around. As for the other things you mentioned, I am concerned about both your physical and emotional safety and well-being. It sounds like your father has an alcohol abuse problem, and living with someone who is struggling with addiction can be hard for anyone, let alone a teenager who is also trying to deal with things like school. You may want to see if your school has a counselor or someone you can talk to about what is going on. I will tell you that in some states, what you have told me may be something that a counselor would have to report to child protection services, but not necessarily. If you are concerned about that, ask the counselor what they are obligated to report. If you don’t know a counselor, think about any other adult that you would feel comfortable talking to. They may have some ideas. Sometimes individual states have non-profit chat lines or hotlines for teens to call if they are struggling with things. You may be able to find something like that in your state. I do warn your about doing random searches, not every website is good, so be careful. This is clearly a tough spot for you to be in, so one of the things that I encourage you to do while searching for support is to focus on taking care of yourself. Sometimes things like this can really bring us down and we stop doing the things we enjoy. Try really hard not to let that happen. If you have interests, do them. If you catch yourself thinking too hard about things, try to find something fun to do to distract yourself. Try to take care of yourself in other ways, such as eating well. Exercise can really help when we get stressed. I hope some of this was helpful. Good luck. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC", "topic": "sleep-improvement"}

He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didn't like this. For our New Year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on board—no more drinking every night. The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not.

He is a good husband in every other regard.", "answer": "Hi Los Angeles,So your husband is giving you mixed messages. He says he's willing to cut back on the drinking, but he drinks and hides it. His behaviour is passive aggressive and immature, which puts you into this position of having to act like a disapproving parent. It sounds more like you're talking about an out-of-control teenager than your partner. Your husband's lying is sending a message. \"I get to make my own decisions and you can't stop me\" might be it. Underneath that, maybe it's \"I want to stop but I'm ashamed that I can't and I don't want you to see my failures\". Ultimately, as an adult, he gets to decide what he puts in his mouth and if you try to manage that by monitoring how many beers he has, you are pretty certain to get some fallout... pushback...backlash... How does his drinking affect you? That's where your voice has power, rather than in counting his beers or setting him up to lie (when he's passed out, asking if he's been drinking seems confusing). You've mentioned snoring, which I guess is a legitimate complaint. If he's passing out, that's a legitimate complaint. When he drinks does he drive, act aggressively, or 'check out of' the relationship (avoid you)? All of these things are legitimate concerns, and I'd stick to talking about those rather than counting beers. My guess is he has few other ways to cope with stress, so he checks out with alcohol, and it also helps him avoid your relationship. But the problem is it makes it worse; the more he avoids you, then more you chase him with your questions.There's a conversation that would be helpful here. It sounds like \"I've tried to support you in your drinking less, and it's not working. What are your goals for alcohol and how can I support you in that more effectively?\" I'd like to see you in a place where you're not micromanaging his drinking, but focusing on the things that affect you. What concrete supportive methods can you use with his agreement? Can we get the alcohol out of the house? Is he willing to seek treatment? Lay your expectations out really clearly. \"I won't count your beers, but I can't tolerate lying\". You have to decide what's more important; is it really the number of beers, or is it something else. What do you need to happen in order to want to remain in the marriage? What does he need? Does he let you know what isn't okay with him? He might have trouble saying these things. The drinking is only a part of the complex dynamic in your marriage.

First, If you can achieve a good erection at anytime without your girlfriend, your penis is fine. However, erections work through getting enough blood flow to the penis. If you are having any sort of mental related concern (anxiety, depression, stress, etc) it can cause your blood vessels to constrict and keep your penis from becoming erect.

If you want to work this out, I would encourage you to work on your thought process and learn to relax your mind and your body (meditation/relaxation exercises). Focus more on enjoying the experience through your 5 senses. What do you smell, take it in and enjoy it. What do you hear, take it in and enjoy it. What do you see, take it in and enjoy it.

First of all, you need to know that although there may be reasons for his behaviour (e.g., not feeling sexually satisfied) those are not excuses. He could have chosen to masturbate instead of cheating on you, right? Your partner needs to own his choices and if he is capable of doing it and is truly willing to work on the relationship with you to make it stronger, more transparent and more fulfilling for both of you, then there is hope. The question is : are you willing to put in all this extra work? Forgiveness is not easy and it may take a lot of time and effort for you to consciously choose to trust again. It won't just happen if you don't work on it. And yes, it's unfair that you are being asked to work on this, when he is the one who had been unfaithful. Even though it is hard, you need to be able to let go at some point of having all the power in the relationship, because right now you have it as the one who had been cheated on. You cannot hold on to being the victim forever because it will create an imbalance in your relationship making it less healthy in the long-run. All of this is hard work.

A book you might find useful is \"The Five Love Languages\".Defining what \"affection\" means to you, and to him, and discovering all the ways you both can show this towards each other, may help lessen some of your anxiety over this.Humans are hard-wired to need appropriate physical touch. In fact, studies have shown that newborns/premies who can receive skin-on-skin contact with their parent can recover faster than babies who don't receive this touch. It's called Kangaroo Care. Children who have grown up in neglectful environments where they're not hugged and kissed and shown appropriate physical contact can often be unable to show this to their partners and children when they're adults. One question to ask yourself is, were you having intimacy issues before starting the medication? If so, there may be other, deeper issues at play here.For someone who has received the wrong kind of sexual/physical touch (sexual abuse, physical beatings) it can be difficult to allow someone to be physically close to you. A therapist could help you work through this.Sometimes, a person may lose their sexual feelings for their partner due to issues in the relationship. Once those issues are resolved, the sex drive comes back. Examine your relationship and see if either of you are unhappy, if you've been arguing a lot, or if there are any problems in your relationship that need to be addressed.Finally, look for the other ways that the two of you may be intimate in a non-sexual way. You may be doing things for each other that you don't even realize, and noticing these will help you appreciate it more. Take the stress off of the sexual gratification and focus on showing your love in other ways. Some people like to give gifts, do the other person's chores, or do other things they think the person will appreciate.If, after all of this, you still have a discrepancy with one of you having a higher sex drive, there are many articles online that offer advice for couples dealing with this situation that you may find useful. It is a very common issue for a lot of couples.", "topic": "intimacy"}
{"id": "counsel_00462", "question": "I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out. How can I approach them about it? should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be up-front about it. I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy. What should I do?", "answer": "Keep doing the crossdressing since you like it.Your problem sounds more a matter of timing and reason to tell the girl about it.Not keeping a secret is a good attitude regarding meaningful parts of your life. Usually our relationship partner is someone whom we trust as a safe person to know all about us.Once you feel at ease with your potential partner then bring up your crossdressing. Based on their handling of this intimate part of your life, you will know more as to whether or not you feel more or less drawn to them.Secrets held within a relationship usually get worse with time. The person who feels unsafe in truly being and stating themselves eventually will end up feeling ashamed of parts of them which prior to the relationship, felt good or at least not worrisome.", "topic": "intimacy"}

{"id": "counsel_00464", "question": "I have been married for 11 years. Within the past 2 years we have drifted far apart. We coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other. I often feel that my husband has \"friends\" at work that he is more emotional invested in than me. I feel very alone and just uncared for. Is there anything I can do to feel reconnected?", "answer": "Your question highlights your pain very clearly. What you are describing is one of the most common scenarios I see in my practice with couples: One partner feels terribly lonely and unimportant in response to the other partner either turning towards other people and activities or being withdrawn and turning inward. My mind immediately goes to a question for you: What happens when you are feeling alone and uncared for? What do you say to yourself about you, about your spouse, and about your relationship? What do you do in response to these feelings? Do you ask for what you need? Does this lead to arguments? Do you stay silent or withdraw?Very often, couples enter into negative patterns where one partner feels afraid of rejection by the other partner and so withdraws from the relationship (and is often seen as \"cold and aloof\" towards the relationship), and the other partner feels afraid of abandonment by the withdrawing partner and so pursues the other (and is often seen as \"critical and nagging\"). Regardless of \"who started it,\" these patterns can turn into infinity loops that take on a gravity of their own, and ultimately cause both partners to withdraw and dissolve the relationship. If both partners want to work on saving and improving the relationship, the way out of this is to learn about your emotions and patterns together so that you can slow down the pattern and stay in touch with the emotions that pull people together. As the patterns slow down, partners are better able to get more deeply in touch with their vulnerabilities, needs and longings, and ask for them to be met in such a way that doesn't leave the other partner feeling criticized, threatened, abandoned, or uncared for.Some couples can do this without the help of a therapist. The book \"Hold Me Tight: 7 Conversations for a LIfetime of Love\" by Sue Johnson is a self-help book based on Emotionally Focused Therapy (the most scientifically validated couples therapy that currently exists), and has been helpful to many couples that I see. When a therapist is needed to help partners reconnect or overcome betrayals, I recommend seeking couples therapists who are trained in a scientifically tested model of couples therapy (such as Emotionally Focused Therapy. You can learn more about EFT or find an EFT therapist here: http://www.iceeft.com).To summarize:Your pain is understandable and valid. It's telling you what you are missing and what you want.Reconnection comes when we can listen to what our feelings are telling us, express those feelings in a safe way, and assert our wants/needs, while remaining open to the vulnerabilities and needs of our partner.If you can do that on your own, and your relationship is responsive, that's fantastic! If you encounter challenges in resolving this yourself, consider therapy with a trained couples therapist using a model that is scientifically validated. Pain means this is important! You and your marriage are worth the effort!", "topic": "intimacy"}

We are pretty transparent and honest, and basically, she feels bad because she never wants to have sex. She doesn't have the desire. She's also never orgasmed. She feels like a terrible wife and fears I'll cheat on her. She doesn't know why. Last time we had sex, she cried and felt bad and didn't know why she cried. However, she also told me that the last time we had sex, she felt me in her, but it just felt \"ehh\" and wanted to stop. That makes me feel really awful. We rarely have foreplay. Everything I try tickles her, so she makes me stop. We are both frustrated but very much in love. She and I are in our early 20s.

Differences in sexual desire between partners is common and can create real friction and conflict. I would encourage you to do some couples counselling or sex therapy as often these issues can be worked through and low sexual desire can result from relational fears and misunderstandings or sex that isn't as arousing as is possible.

I have full access to his phone, social media, and e-mails. I never find anything, but I'm obsessed with constantly checking just in case. How do I stop this? It's driving a wedge between us.", "answer": "Hi Greenville, I respect that you're owning your own overreactions, and that you want to give your boyfriend the respect he deserves. The truth is that some people cheat, and some don't, and our partners deserve the benefit of the doubt unless they show signs they can't be trusted.The answer here is in two different areas. Basically, if you want to feel differently (more trusting, in your case), you look at your thoughts, and your behaviours.Your thoughts are stuck... like tires in deep ruts in the road. These thoughts are only habits, they don't reflect the truth. Fear is probably whispering in your ear things like \"everyone cheats\", or \" you're not enough for him\". Once you figure out what fear is trying to tell you, picture those words in red next time they come up. Ask yourself what the evidence is that supports that thought (there won't be much...perhaps none), and what is the evidence that doesn't support it (I know lots of good men, I know I deserve love and loyalty, there is no sign of infidelity...). You're learning to refute the thoughts that are connected to the fear. That's the first half. Practise these thoughts.The rest of the work is in your behaviours. Act as though you trust him. Force yourself to not check or interrogate, and the less you check, the less obsessive and untrusting you will feel. Acting \"as if\" something if true strangely helps us believe it.It's possible to change the way we think, and this is turn changes the way we feel. Try this to start, and see a therapist for support and cognitive behavioural therapy if you want to dive more deeply into why this is happening and how to stop it. Good luck!", "topic": "intimacy"}

Even though you aren't finding evidence of cheating, your weak sense of faith in your wife's behavior is worth examining bc trust is fundamental to a good relationship.It is possible you don't have faith in yourself to accurately tell whether someone is telling you the truth or whether you are interpreting evidence accurately.Anyone who has themselves had their trust severely violated will feel uneasy to naively trust what is on face value.The work requires observing your own confidence in gradually feeling safe that what someone tells you is true, is actually true.Examine as much evidence as needed of whether what the other person tells you they're doing, does in fact take place.When the facts line up and show you no reason to be fearful, then you will be one step closer to trusting yourself to trust someone else.", "topic": "intimacy"}

All of this can be handled if you really want to fix it in your marriage.You can have more in your marriage with some help. You can stop having affairs if you get help.

He has stranded me. He uses his passive-aggressive ways and ignores every comment I make. He refuses to talk to me in detail.", "answer": "Hi Smyrna,Your husband is avoiding dealing with this problem. I understand how lonely you must feel, not only sexually, but emotionally too.From what you describe, it seems that he wants to be there for you, but he clearly has barriers to engaging fully around this issue. My hunch is that he doesn't know what to do or how to talk to you. But I think he does have something to say.Your husband is 29 years older and you've been together for ten years...that puts you at around thirty perhaps and him at almost sixty? Has any wise older woman sat you down to explain that men sometimes have erectile issues or hormone-related low sex drive as they age? It's possible that your husband is bewildered, angry, grieving or anxious about changes in his sex drive or his ability to maintain an erection, and that he doesn't know how to talk to you about this. He may feel like he's letting you down, and he's scared it will get worse, so he's sticking his head in the sand. Of course, that doesn't help, does it?The worst case scenario is that you get angry or hopeless, that he senses danger or disapproval from you and pulls away even further in shame. Eventually, you stop chasing him, and you drift further apart. It's a bit of a conundrum...how to honour both your need for connection and honesty and his need for a safe place to explore his fears and insecurities. Maybe lower your expectations for a bit? Your husband will need to believe that you are a safe place to share his fears, and you would need to hold onto the fact that he's really scared, and that he's not rejecting you...just protecting himself.I would suggest having a gentle conversation that sounds something like \"Sweetheart, we both know that something's not right here. I think you've been trying to handle this on your own or hoping it would get better, but can we agree that it's not? I need you to either talk to me about what's happening, or please go see a doctor. What I need is to see that you are doing some little step to help us. Either of those things would show me that.\"In the end, you need to know that he's heard you and that he's willing to look at the issue in some way.

You'll more likely succeed with concentrating with small time spans than longer ones.Once you start seeing your success, this will motivate you to try increasing the length to expect yourself to concentrate.The task of self-reminding is the same, whether for long or short time periods.Also, before starting this exercise ask your medical doctor if the problem can be related to a physical health problem.If there is, then have the possibility ruled out that your difficulty concentrating comes from the mental ability to concentrate, and not some medical reason preventing this.Before someone can engage their psychological will there must be a clean medical body and mind with which to work.", "topic": "intimacy"}

A few things may help with that:Try having the conversation you are both able to have a conversation about something that is important (for example, not during a commercial for a TV show)Maybe your boyfriend will be willing to listen to you for about five minutes asking questions to learn more about your experience, kind of like an investigative reporter wouldSee if your boyfriend is able to capture the essence of what you're saying by summarizing it for youRemember that hearing you and following what you're saying does not mean that he agreesAlso consider if there are events in your past that are affecting the way you are looking at this relationship between your boyfriend and this other girl (we all bring our own histories into relationships and we unconsciously expect that what has worked in other relationships will work in current ones)Then you can switch so that you can hear more about what he is experiencing (for example, what it is that he likes about her)Also consider having a discussion that if one of you becomes very emotional and needs a break from the discussion, discuss having a timeout that will last for a certain time frame (usually between 15 minutes and one hour) and then come back to continue the discussionRemember that the goal here is just to learn more about what each of you is going through, not to find a solution right awayThis can be difficult.

{"id": "counsel_00488", "question": "I’m a man, and I’m soon to be married. I have been messing around with other men on the side. It started as a once in a while thing, but it’s been happening a lot. I don't know what to do.", "answer": "Hello, and thank you for your question. When faced with these kinds of difficult challenges, I usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be. Indeed, it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we don't feel very content with our lives. Perhaps you can take some time to think through a couple of these questions: What kind of person do I want to be deep in my heart? What kind of character do I want to have when in public and in my private world when nobody is watching? How would I want others to describe me? Let's say that you want others to see you as being authentic, and YOU also value authenticity as something you want to live by. You may feel like this value is currently at odds with the behaviors you are engaging in right now. That you are not being the person that you really are deep in your heart. This is not an unusual struggle when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual orientation. So please, try not to feel alone. We all know quite well how unacceptable it may be to be seen as gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc. And I am not just talking about being unaccepted by others, but a person may have a VERY hard time accepting themselves. Thinking about your values and living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom, but I won't lie, it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time. For example, someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for, even if that means people may disapprove. That may cause a lot of pain, but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity. It may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy, which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right for them. I would also sit down and think through some of the questions above and consider what your values are... both as an individual and as someone's fiancé.Above all, I wish you well in this journey.

{"id": "counsel_00491", "question": "Ever since my ex-boyfriend and I broke up, I can't seem to get close to anyone else. I know I'm completely over him, but I just can't break down my walls and let someone new into my life.", "answer": "Hi Bend, You're scared, right? That makes sense. Each time we have a break-up we are a bit more in touch with how much is at stake in this whole love and relationship business. We are falling in love and letting someone close to our hearts and there's a vulnerability in that; we can get hurt. Who you partner with long-term is a big decision and it determines 90% of our happiness in life. The good news is that when we're just starting to get to know someone, we can take it slow. I think maybe you are slowing yourself down instinctively here, and that's okay. We are naturally people of attachment and it won't likely last if you are normally an open and accessible person who doesn't put up walls. So part of what I want to say here is don't pressure yourself too much. Take the time to heal naturally and listen to your instinct that is telling you to take things slow. :)As well, there are a few things you can do to make sure that the walls do eventually come down, or will come down for the right person. First, think about the lessons you learned from this past relationship. What do you feel proud of? What do you need in a partner? What mistakes did you make? Use this experience to grow in your awareness of how you work in a relationship and what you need from a partner.Look at your thoughts. Are you having generalized negative thoughts like \"No one will ever love me again?\", or \"I'm going to get hurt again\", or \"I can't trust myself\"? If so, write down what these thoughts are, and then ask yourself what evidence supports these thoughts. Fear tries to convince us that there is either something wrong with us or that something bad will happen, but it does so with little or no evidence of this ever happening!! It sells us a line based on no concrete evidence. Then ask yourself what evidence supports the opposite thought. What is the evidence that I am lovable... that there are safe, good people out there... that I can trust myself? Eliminate the negative thoughts, and add the positive ones. It's simple but very powerful.Lastly, take concrete and careful steps to act as though there are no walls. What is the evidence of the walls? Can you take purposeful baby steps in the direction of lowering those walls? When we act as though something is true, we start to feel it and believe it more.I hope you will find yourself back on track eventually, with time. :)", "topic": "intimacy"}

Being able to assertively identify express your wants and needs to your boyfriend may be helpful in times of negotiation. Often couples focus on recounting all the negative traits and issues when is time to negotiate and that impairs the ability to explore and find solutions objectively.You could use couples mediation to learn assertive communication skills and filter the information needed to resolve or negotiate a solution. Mi novio no transa conmigoÚltimamente, mi novio y yo hemos tenido muchos desacuerdos. Todo se debe al hecho de que queremos cosas diferentes. Yo hago mucho por él, lo cuido y protejo, y al final, el no confía en mí. Ambos hemos llegado a la conclusión que cuando yo quiero algo que él no quiere, él no está dispuesto a encontrar el punto medio. No es negociable. No estoy segura de que hacer. El no confía en mi tanto como quisiera que lo hiciera, a veces siento su enemiga y eso me mata. Hay una gran diferencia entre lo que quieres, lo que necesitas y lo que tienes. Poder identificar y expresar asertivamente lo que quieres y necesitas en tu relación te ayudara en los momentos de negociación.

But it sounds like you may be feeling stuck in a pattern of pushing people away and are wanting to change that. Pushing others away may be your way of surviving relationships and may have proven to be very helpful at one point in your life. Or it may be serving some other purpose. One helpful way to consider changing that is to seek out a therapist. Psychotherapy can provide you with a relationship that is in tune to you and that can provide the reflection and supportive challenges to help determine the function the 'pushing away' is serving. It also may be helpful for you to take time to reflect on the moments when interpersonal guardedness snuck its way into the interaction. What were you feeling right before this? Did it provide relief? Reflecting on what was happening just before and right after can provide some clues as to what purpose the 'pushing away' serves.It may be helpful to communicate to the boyfriend how you experience intimacy and the discomfort it can bring you at times.

What should I do?", "answer": "First off, don't blame yourself or be too quick to jump to any scary conclusions. Human sexuality can be incredibly complex at times (e.g., what turns us on at one time may not be what turns us on the next time). There could actually be a number of things going on including him having performance anxiety...maybe he had a bad experience with a previous partner that's left him scared to try again (we call this operant conditioning). It could also be that he puts you in a different category than previous lovers. Sometimes I refer to this as the \"hooker-housewife mentality\" where a partner somehow gets the idea that when we truly fall in love, we treat that one differently; almost up on a pedestal. Drives many partners crazy until they're aware that this is going on and give their boyfriend/ girlfriend permission to enjoy both the naughty and the nice with them. It could also be that he's not even aware that he's not doing these things. If you haven't asked him yet, you might try gently approaching the subject when you're not already in the bedroom or trying to get in on and inquire what he most enjoys about sex with you (or has enjoyed in the past, or thinks he might enjoy). You can also share your favorite highlights of sex with him. Give him an ego boost and tell him what he does well while then asking him if he'd be down to go downtown. \"Baby, it REALLY turns me on when you kiss me during sex.\"If you continue to get the impression that it's somehow only about YOU or that he's just really hesitant to talk about sex in general, you might see if he'd be cool to chat with a counselor who specializes in sexual intimacy.", "topic": "intimacy"}

By trying to control whether or not you visit your mom, unless you are in agreement with this, is building tension between you and him.Ask why he resents your interest to see your mother.If he is insecure to the point where he fears your mother will influence your opinion about him, then trying to prevent you from visiting your mom is itself creating negativity in you toward him.If something still bothers him about the problems you both had several months ago, then talking about these problems will do more to clear the air between the two of you than him trying to interfere in your relationship with your mother.", "topic": "intimacy"}

If you are focused on every little detail around your relationship, it may turn into an unhealthy obsession and it may harm your relationship more. If instead you focus on opening the lines of communication, let him know what you expect from him, and discuss how you could both build trust again, you may become closer and give your relationship the opportunity to grow. ¿Debería este molesta porque mi esposo me mintió de nuevo?Estoy tratando de hacer que mi matrimonio funcione después de una separación.

You cannot make him do anything to support you with this, but you can certainly ask.What is something you could start or stop doing to move you toward your goal?", "topic": "intimacy"}

I don't know how well the two of you have communicated over the last year, but if you are concerned about this turning into an argument, you may consider asking him to just listen to your point of view and see if he is able to summarize it correctly.

It may also be helpful to ask if you could talk for two or three minutes to make a point and then have space for her to talk for the same amount of time. You can adjust the timing for what works for both of you. After one of you is talking, perhaps you could restate what you have heard the person say. This can lessen confusion.I know you say that she avoids it. It might be a good place to start talking about it – to see what makes her avoid it. It could be that she thinks any discussion about them is going to lead to an argument or you saying that she can't talk to them. I don't know how you typically react when you are jealous, but if you can discuss talking about this in a way that you are both open to hearing what the other person is experiencing, that may be helpful as well.", "topic": "intimacy"}

Friendships that develop in times of struggle may be a great emotional support, but also become confusing there's sexual attraction. And entertaining a tough is only going to make it a stronger target. Careful with that friendship! You do not want to fill your marriage's void with another person. Even when you are in a friend zone and not having intimacy with this person, you may be developing a special bond, sharing interest and activities that may lead to a deeper connection. Ask yourself how you would feel if your spouse was having a friendship like that.Then try to refocus on your marriage. I suggest being transparent and talking to your wife about your feelings and concerns. Ask her what you could do to reconnect, make some suggestions and dedicate time to practice them. Make time in both of your schedules, make an effort to have lunch together, or to text during the day. Remember that a marriage is like a very good friendship with benefits, but sometimes the responsibility kills the fun.¿Cómo puedo volver a enamorarme de mi esposa?Mi esposa trabaja tarde casi todos los días, la amo con todo mi corazón, pero no siento la intimidad como antes.

Las amistades que se desarrollan en momentos de crisis pueden ser un gran apoyo emocional, pero también pueden convertirse en algo nebuloso cuando hay atracción sexual. Entretener pensamientos al respecto solo lo va a hacer un reto más grande. ¡Ten cuidado con esa amistad! No quieres llenar el vacío que deja tu matrimonio con esta nueva persona. Aunque no estés teniendo intimidad con esa persona, puedes estar creando una conexión especial, compartiendo intereses en común y actividades que los unen más aun. Pregúntate como te sentirías si tu esposa tuviera una amistad así.Intenta reenfocarte en tu matrimonio. Sugiero que seas transparente con tu esposa y le dejes saber tu preocupación y como te sientes con el distanciamiento. Pregúntale que le gustaría hacer para reconectarse, sugiérele algunas ideas y dediquen tiempo a las mismas.

I suggest to talk to him about how you feel, let him know that although he is gone for a long time, his presence as a husband and father are required and important. Ask him if he will be willing to engage again and how he would like to do so. Many times when the dads are away, moms design a perfect routine and they feel like they will disturb it.

If he can't accept or feel comfortable with who you are and decisions you've made, there's already a level of discomfort here that shouldn't be ignored. No, he doesn't have the right to penalize you or punish you ...not just for past things...not for anything. What he does get to do it tell you how it affects him.

You would really enjoy some sexual activities that your wife hasn't initiated in a long while, but it's a big leap to go from that to \"I married the wrong person\". Fear is telling you that she doesn't respect or like or want you? Look at the bigger picture. What is the evidence that your wife wants to please you?...that she is the \"right\" woman for you?...that she loves you?...that she cares about what's important to you? If there is evidence there, then you owe it to the marriage to rein in your fearful thoughts.Talking to your wife is so important right now. We all have moments when we really just want to sit and stew in our self pity over our partner not vacuuming or cooking or saying loving things often enough...but they can't read our minds! Can you lovingly let her know what you miss? ...what you hope for?...what you need? This is the meat of a loving relationship. Sharing who we are, so that we can love each other better.

{"id": "counsel_00524", "question": "We don't have sex a lot. I cheat when we argue. I don't kiss or have unprotected sex with them. It's a one time thing, and I never see them twice.", "answer": "Hello, and thank you for your question. The question about whether or not to cheat is based on personal values that can only be answered by you. However, here are a few things to consider and questions to ask yourself to help you find your answer: 1. Do you feel like you are violating your own values or morals? This is important, because we all have different values and morals surrounding sex, love, and monogamy. If you value monogamous relationships and find yourself cheating on your partner, then you may feel like you are living in contradiction to your values, and most people are not happy when they do that. However, if monogamy is not something you value, then perhaps it is time to re-evaluate the relationship and determine if it is still right for you. Not all people want monogamous relationships, and that is alright. Finally, if you value your husband’s feelings and know that the affairs would hurt him, then your behaviors may again be in contrast to your own values. That can only be determined by you. 2. Based on how you describe your relationship, it sounds like you are not very satisfied with the way it is. From the outside, it looks like the affairs are a way to “get even” with your husband or to feel better after an argument. This is something that can happen when mutual respect starts to fade in a relationship and gets replaced with contempt. We can simply stop caring about how our actions hurt each other, or potentially hurt each other. Perhaps the question to ask here is, when you look out toward the future with your husband, is this the pattern that you want to keep? The pattern of very little sex, argument, and then satisfying the pain or dissatisfaction with affairs. 3. What are your goals for this relationship? If we start to become disconnected in a relationship, we can begin to do things on autopilot. Get up, get the kids up, go to work, come home, and go to bed. None of which requires any intimacy at all. Are you still able to see the hopes and dreams you once had for this relationship? 4. Have you considered seeking marital counseling? Not having affairs won’t actually fix the part of the relationship that is leading you to have them. If there is something broken, it sometimes requires some help to get it fixed. Hopefully these questions and thoughts will help you come to some kind of conclusion about what is right for you and your relationship. I certainly wish you well. Robin J.

{"id": "counsel_00525", "question": "I am a female, and I am afraid of having sex. I am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced. I think he thinks I'm not a virgin. I am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body. I don't want my partner to think differently of me because I am afraid of having sex.", "answer": "These fears are completely normal. Almost everyone has the same fears you do, to some degree, especially if they lack experience. Men also feel far more of these fears than you realize. That can help...to remember that we're all a little scared and looking for safety and approval.You mention a partner, but I'm not sure if you currently have one. Having a partner you can trust with your fears and who you feel safe with is so important. When you're really confident someone cares deeply for you, this can help the fears to go away or diminish. How well do you know your own body? Getting to know how you like to be touched and how different touches feel...getting acquainted with your body yourself first...this can help build sexual confidence. In general, our partners care less about our fat and wrinkles than they care about how we make them feel in bed. Being a generous lover who is confident enough to put fear aside...ironically this is what makes you \"good in bed\". But be patient with yourself. Your confidence will grow with experience, and that doesn't have to happen until you are ready. There's not rush. :)", "topic": "intimacy"}
{"id": "counsel_00526", "question": "I am married, but I had sex with my friend. I feel guilty, but I feel not guilty too. Do I need to feel guilty? It's my body, and I have full rights to do what I like.", "answer": "I don't think there's anything that you're supposed to feel. Some people feel tremendously guilty when they cheat, and others not at all. It could be that your partner doesn't know about the cheating and you haven't had to face his/her emotions and reactions. When something we do is hidden...a secret...it's easier to avoid feeling guilty. I wonder if you're avoiding your own emotions. But let's put that question aside for now. There are better questions.What do you want? Do you want your marriage? If not, this may be why you don't feel guilty. Do you want to be able to sleep with your friend? It's unlikely that both are possible (keeping the marriage and the affair). Yes, you get to do whatever you want with your body...and...there may be consequences. Affairs almost always get discovered. Who do you want to be? What kind of partner do you want to be? What might your partner feel if they knew? How might you feel then? Would you care? Has something happened that's affected how much you care about your partner?I suggest that these other questions might be a place to start. Exploring it with a therapist is something to consider maybe. I wish you the best as you sort it out. :)", "topic": "intimacy"}

Don't allow their problems to become your problem. You didn't mention that your partner in your present relationship have done anything to make you not trust them.

{"id": "counsel_00528", "question": "We had our first kid 15 years ago, and sex has been nonexistent ever since. It only happens every three or four months. We have been to counseling, and I have been told over and over again she will come around. She hasn't, and I'm intimately lonely! I think it's time to move on, but how do I do that without hurting my kids?", "answer": "Hi Pocahontas, This is a painful situation. When you're in a relationship, you assume that you will continue to receive warmth and affection. When it dries up, it's a very lonely place. It's possible that there is an unaddressed issue in the relationship. It's also possible that your partner has hormonal issues, pain issues, sexual dysfunction or is asexual. There is no one answer here. Only you can decide what is right for you. But let me ask some questions to help you explore next steps:Aside from the sex, is your wife loving and supportive? What are the other ways in which you feel loved? Does your wife talk to you? Does she communicate her needs and desires? Does she articulate what gets in the way of having sex? If your wife is generally a loving, open partner, you use this to see that her behaviours aren't personal. Whether she resolves this or not, it can help you to cope with the rejection. This is your wife's issue, and the \"ball\" is in her court.In my opinion, if couple's therapy hasn't helped, it's time for your wife to own whatever is blocking her and address it with her physician and therapist. Let her be in charge of the sex for a while, to take the pressure off, and she can have the time to figure out what gets in the way of having regular sexual intimacy in your relationship. If you think of this as \"my wife is in crisis and needs support in figuring this out\", it can help you manage your own emotions. Pressure to have sex might push her further away. Did the couple therapist help you to see the dynamic in your relationship? Has your partner identified something she feels she is lacking in the relationship? One good way to make sure you \"get\" is to \"give\" (and I mean give what she wants, not sex). It's appropriate to say to her now \"I cannot live in a relationship with so little intimacy. I need for you to be honest with me about what you want for us sexually. If this is all you want, I'm not sure I can do it. If you want us to be more sexual, I need you to address what gets in the way for you.\" Give her some time, help her in any way you can, and then see where you are. See if she does seek help to address an issue that is hers. Then...you have a decision to make. I encourage you to make it looking at the big picture, not just the sex.", "topic": "intimacy"}

I have been talking to a guy friend, and I feel more loved by him than my boyfriend.", "answer": "Hi Michigan, Relationships are so sparkly for a few years, and then things start to feel different. Most of the time, this is simply because we've pulled back from all the attachment-forming behaviours we did at the beginning. We stop talking a lot, because we have less to discover...we do less for each other and buy fewer gifts...spend less time together...all because we have already formed the love and attachment and we don't need to \"fill the gas tank\" as much. So, just because it feels different doesn't mean it's \"gone bad\".Having said that, it seems as though you are missing something in this relationship that you need; you don't feel loved enough right now. Can you tell him? Have you told him? The strength of your relationship is more clear when people know what the expectations are. Let him know what you need, and see if he gets it. You have choices to make and there is no wrong choice. You certainly have the right to say \"this isn't feeling great anymore\", or \"I want to explore other relationships\", and walk away. But often it's worth it to see how good something can be before you bail. You're drawn to someone else, and this is up to you to decide how this fits with your expectations of yourself in a relationship. Your interest in this other guy is sparkly and new. Your boyfriend can't compete with that if he doesn't know you're unhappy. For some people, being drawn to someone else is a sign they're not into their partner.

It can be scary, frustrating, and lonely. Have you tried talking to him about your concerns? I would suggest to start there. There may be several reasons for his actions, some of which may have nothing to do with how he feels for you. Learning about what is going on for him will likely answer your questions and, depending on his response, may cause some relief. When initiating conversations about subjects that are sensitive, there are a few things that you want to remember. Tell him how you are feeling and what you are experiencing, rather than blaming him or telling him what he is doing wrong. Avoid using extreme, black and white language (i.e. always and never). For example, you may say something such as, \"I feel confused that we are rarely intimate and I'm wondering if you've also noticed this change\" versus \"You are never intimate with me anymore.\" Don't be afraid to ask him questions. You deserve to know what is going on, as his behavior is effecting your well being. I like to ask open-ended questions instead of yes and no questions. It allows for more clarity and deeper explanation. Lastly, ask yourself (and possibly him) what part you play in the recent changes. Does he feel that you've been distant? Does he need something from you? Let him know that you are willing to work things out as a team. If communication attempts fail, seeing a couple's therapist can be a great benefit. Having an objective party to coach you through this difficut time can give you the support that will create lasting changes in your relationship.Best of luck to you!", "topic": "intimacy"}

I totally get that it's hard, and I believe it's worth it if you truly love and want to be with someone. You can be stronger in the scarred places. I would suggest that you each have a separate job to do to rebuild this trust. It is definitely possible to rebuild it, because anything is possible if both people want it enough.Your boyfriend came clean to you...this is pretty crucial. He chose to honour your needs rather than keep the secret. You can use that as evidence in your \"proof that he loves me\" file. Work on that file...thicken it up. Having a thick \"he does care about me and wouldn't hurt me again\" file will help you. Other things that he can do to help you thicken that file (because after all, his behaviours caused this problem): answer all your questions, don't brush you off if you're feeling insecure, treat you as though you're a priority, avoid questionable contact with other women, have open communication, give you passwords to devices so there is transparency. He can help you to understand where those behaviours came from...why he cheated in the first places (although people aren't always good with those 'why' questions!)You can focus on telling yourself that people change, that he deserves a chance to show you he can be loyal (or at least you've decided to give him that chance), and that you want to be a trusting person. If you act like a trusting person, you will likely feel more like one. Don't go snooping, don't interrogate him. It's normal you might feel scared and try to tell him that when you do.

When you have your data recorded, read on...The first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and you've developed fears that you will be hurt again or that you're not enough to keep someone interested (this is just fear...people cheat for their own reasons, not because we're not interesting). This may be true if what you wrote down is \"They didn't really do anything wrong...there is no evidence. I'm just scared and suspicious\". That's a cue to do some self reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like \"nothing has really happened. I can trust.\"If what you wrote down was vague evidence, like for example your partner has been distant or irritable, or you're having less sex than usual, you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions. Trust your gut, but your gut isn't seeing evidence of cheating...it's evidence of \"something\". Ask your partner what's up with accusations or assumptions.The third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating. Maybe there are texts on a phone, or someone has told you something they saw. I'd say when there is some evidence, it's okay to present this to your partner and ask what's going on. If this happens repeatedly, and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that don't make sense, then it's okay to do a bit of \"research\" and be extra aware of what's going on around you.

He’ll tell me that he'll stop lying, and while he’s saying that, he's hiding something or lying about something. First, it was about a girl.

He's capable of being manipulative and deceitful, and he even lies as he's telling you he'll stop lying. What you're doing is called denial; when you see evidence of something but you choose not to believe the evidence.

In order for us to move on, he wants me to sign this contract that he wrote out listing things he doesn't want me to do anymore.

Will you have a list too? There are elements of control here: humiliating you in front of coworkers, saying you have to sign the contract before you can move forward...does he decide when you move in and out? Your passive aggressive communications with the other man and your difficulty in knowing what direction you want also hint that maybe you don't have a voice in this relationship. Do you have a voice? If you are uncomfortable with the contract, are you listening to your own voice? If you can't hear your own voice, maybe it's time to sit down with a therapist and strengthen yourself so you can at least know what you feel and want.No relationship is all good or all bad (wouldn't that make it easy?) Relationships don't come with billboards that tell us what to do. They don't come with crystal balls that tell us what will happen (except that past behaviour is a good predictor). You have everything you need in order to make the best decision for you right now, except clarity, and his control may be what is making things muddy for you.

It really kills me, and I can't stop thinking about it.", "answer": "Your sense of hurt is very understandable.Do you and your boyfriend have an agreement on looking through each other's phones?I ask because the overall problem sounds like lack of trust and that there may be a difference in what each of you wants and expects from your relationship.Probably if the two of you talk about these topics and you each become clear as to the commitment status of each of you to the other, you'll have more clarity as to what either of you would like from the other.With this new level of clarity, his past relationship involvements will likely be less meaningful .Once you have clear definition of the two of you as a couple, who he was as a past partner to someone else, will matter very little.", "topic": "intimacy"}

I get how upsetting this is.If I was your therapist, I'd want to explore this a good deal, because there are several possibilities concerning what might be happening. Be careful not to jump to conclusions. Sometimes people have been slowly \"falling out of love\" for a long time, and often this is due to some (perhaps unnamed) unmet need in the marriage. She may have been coming to this point over a period of time, and has only finally said so. It's also possible that your wife is going through some temporary crisis...she's changing and personally unhappy and blaming the marriage for it. Only she can help herself through this (she could get the help of a therapist, but it's not your place to tell her to do this). Or, it's possible she's met this new \"friend\" and her attachment to him has clouded her view, or clarified something for her. Right now, it's important that you respect your wife's decision to separate, if she's asking for that. We can't trap people in a marriage. If she needs separation, or distance, then it's respectful to give her that.That doesn't mean that you have to give up on the marriage right now. I would seek the support of a therapist who can help you sort out what YOU want; whether it's to move on with your life, or wait patiently for a period of time. I can't predict what will happen here.

If you feel pressured into being sexually active by your friends or boyfriend it is understandable that you want it to be over. I would encourage you to ask your boyfriend to be patient with you at this time until you figure out what is going on. I encourage you to then think very deeply about what your reservations, if any, about being sexually active. Do you fear pregnancy? Are there problems in the relationship? Are you afraid of the emotional intimacy? Another question that comes to mind is whether or not you have any history of sexual activity that you did not consent to that might be getting in the way. When these types of traumatic events occur, people can essentially become triggered negatively by anything that reminds them of past trauma. Such events can cause an aversion to sex even if there is now a loving relationship whom one wants to be sexually active with. If this is the case I strongly recommend individual therapy to begin working through some of these issues. A final area that you might explore would be whether or not you are experiencing pain with penetration. If so, I would recommend that you schedule an appointment with a gynecologist to rule out any type of medical issues that might be causing these problems. Although pain can also be associated with emotional issues, it is always good to rule out possible physical causes. I hope that these ideas help to point you in the right direction.

Being unable to trust your significant other certainly can cause one to feel unsettled. Has your spouse ever done anything questionable that would cause you to not trust her? If so, then it will take time and some work to gain the trust back. Couple's counseling would be of benefit. If not, then you may want to consider seeing a therapist on your own in order to better learn where your insecurities come from. There are several possible reasons why you may be feeling insecure but without knowing them, the issue is not likely to get resolved. In the meantime, I suggest that when you're feeling upset and are unable to trust what your wife says/does, think before you speak. Ask yourself if you have valid reasons to not trust her. Instead of arguing, try and communicate how you're feeling and let her know that resolving this trust issue will be a top priority for you so that you can focus on other aspects of your relationship.

If you both want the relationship to improve, a couple's therapist who works in sexuality is a great idea; it's a complex picture that you've only given us a glimpse of.In the meantime, you can try a few things: have compassion for your wife. She's in pain and this may preoccupy her. Sex may be uncomfortable for her. She needs understanding. You need understanding too, right? Help her to see that you're not just angry, but lonely and hurt; it might affect how you see yourself as a man. Showing her irritability or anger might push her farther away.There are many ways to be close, intimate, and sexual that don't involve intercourse. You might want to explore some of these things and reassure her that you won't pressure her to have intercourse. Find out what your wife's wishes and ideas are.

I took him back months later, and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes. However, we continued to have issues because of my lack of trust. My insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse, which lead to us separating again. During that separation, he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with. But we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until I got pregnant with our second child. The baby was a few months old, and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her. He told me how he could never stop talking to her and how, during our issues, she has been and is the only women he's gone behind my back with (but on a friendship level because she's miles away). He confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like he's possibly in love with her too. He said he feels like he's in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him, and she hasn't been able to leave him alone since. Even though she knows that he's still with me and happy with our family, she can’t help it, and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual. Being that he loves me too, he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time. He wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels, but he didn't want me to find out, so he told me everything. He said he didn't want to continue to lie to me and so I can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when it's only been this one girl the whole time. He feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her, and that no matter what he did to do right, I would still accuse him. He's caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesn't want me to leave him because I'm the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life.

Partners usually want to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you have or if there is anything you don’t like to do. This gets into a gray area for some people. I don’t necessarily want to know how many people my partner has been with and I certainly don’t want a whole lot of details. Sometimes that is an image I just don’t want in my head about my partner. Vague details are usually enough.However, I understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past. This is a reflection on him, not you. This shows insecurities on his part. You cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information. The past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future. If he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship. You can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you. I have seen relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity. It takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though. If your boyfriend cannot get over your past, you may have to let him go. Don’t keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you. Constantly holding your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low self-esteem due to this type of treatment. I don’t see that you have done anything wrong. If you aren’t cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your past honestly, how he handles that information is on him. Ultimately, relationships have a tendency to come and go. Don’t fight to hold onto someone who is not right for you. It is okay to be single and enjoy being the best you that you can be. In time, the right person for you will enter your life.", "topic": "intimacy"}
{"id": "counsel_00561", "question": "I have no sex drive due to medical issues. I’ve shut down completely and closed everyone out. I’ve even told my husband that I wanted a divorce since that’s what I thought he wanted to hear. However, it devastated me when I learned he's seeing someone else. I’ve since told him that I wanted to work things out but he’s not sure I actually mean it. He thinks the only reason I want him back is because I’m jealous. How do I show him I’m serious?", "answer": "I’m sorry to hear about your current situation. My heart goes out to you during this time.First of all, it is of vital importance that you discuss your symptoms with your doctor. Regardless of whether you are able to mend your relationship with your husband, you need to address the physical issues you are experiencing. More than likely he/she will be able to help you relieve some of these symptoms.Secondly, you must be upfront and honest with your husband. Intimacy is a large part of a relationship and it is unfair to your husband that you did not disclose how you were feeling. I think he would appreciate knowing that it was your medical problems causing the lack of sexual desire as opposed to the reason being him.If you explain to him that you are addressing your sexual issues with your doctor in order to enhance your relationship, he may be more willing to see that you are serious in wanting to mend the relationship. The conversation will be hard to explain to your doctor and your husband since it is of such a personal nature but it will be extremely beneficial. And please note that the reason for the feelings you were experiencing (or lack thereof), was not your fault.Best of luck to you and your husband!", "topic": "intimacy"}

You are noticing that grief changes, it doesn't just stop. You have recognized that there will be moments in life that you will want to have shared with your brother and grandma and it just seems unfair that you cannot. I often find that when someone is stuck in the place you are, it is a result of unfinished business and in your case, it appears, unfinished futures. A professional versed in grieving and it's intricacies, can guide you to navigate through this and lessen the intensity that you experience. As life goes on, there will be many moments that you will have wished they were present, but those moments do not have to bring you such intense emotion.

{"id": "counsel_00564", "question": "Last year, I just always felt hopeless. I don't have a great relationship with my sister. I lost my mother recently, and that really added to my sadness. My sister always brings up how I was never close to my mother.", "answer": "I am so sorry about your loss. Losing someone you love is always difficult, however, losing a mother is a significant loss in a daughters life. What makes this loss complicated is that it appears you have also had a loss in your relationship with your sister. It is difficult to know what happened with your sister with the limited information you have provided, but what I suspect is that there are some unresolved issues between the two of you and that she may be projecting her pain on to you. It is important to remember that your sister is also grieving the loss of your mother and may not be dealing with it in a very healthy way. By her bringing up your relationship with your mother and suggesting that you were \"never close\" to her is her opinion. Only you can define and determine what your relationship was like with your mother. If there is truth to this, then it may be something you may need to talk about with a counselor. There could be an added layer of ambiguous loss in that you are not only grieving her physical absence, but could be grieving the loss of a relationship you wish you could have had with her and the realization that you never will. You and your sister are both in the heart of the grieving cycle. When two people are grieving the same loss at the same time, it is difficult to provide support to each other because of their own struggle, even if they both were on good terms with each other. Depression is part of the cycle of grief. It is absolutely normal to feel sad, as well as experiencing other depressive symptoms (i.e., feelings of isolation, lack of motivation, low energy, sleep or appetite changes, etc.). Anger is another phase of the grief cycle. Your sister may be stuck in the anger phase, not wanting to connect with her own feelings of sadness, so this may be why she is being hurtful towards you, in projecting her anger onto you in order to avoid the vulnerability of experiencing her own grief.Finally, it appears that your depression proceeded the loss of your mother and is making your experience with grief more complicated. Were you officially diagnosed and treated for depression prior to your loss? Depression in grief is different than a depressive mood disorder. Depression can be situational (i.e., triggered by an event) or related to genetics, undiagnosed health issues, stress, trauma or other potential risk factors. If you have a family history of depression, you are more susceptible to have depression. It would be wise for you to discuss this with a mental health provider, and if necessary, get treatment through counseling and medical interventions.", "topic": "grief-and-loss"}

How do I move past that and live more in the present?", "answer": "Do some self-reflecting as to what areas of your life you'd currently like to develop.The good news is you know how happiness feels.That you were able to create situations and dynamics which produced happiness in your life is good motivation to believe happiness is possible and to try new ways to create this in your life.", "topic": "grief-and-loss"}

Do you see it? \"I feel guilty about my father's death\", and \"I spent my WHOLE LIFE taking care of my dad.\" Wow. After everyone else had left him to his misery, you hung in there. He is so lucky to have had you there. You didn't have to do that. I have a hunch that your dad blamed you for a lot of things. Abusive people do that a lot; they make you believe things are your fault when they're not. You did the opposite of what you fear you did. You didn't contribute to your dad's death; your selfless care gave him a longer life...better health. In the end, no one's love and care could save him. No one could fault you for deciding you had had enough at some point. I would never expect anyone to keep putting themselves in a hurting place over and over again. But this is what you did. You did it for him, and you did it so you wouldn't feel guilty. But you feel guilty anyway, right?...so putting yourself in that position was only worth it if you allow your loving acts to melt away the guilt. Can you tell yourself \"It's okay that I had to take care of myself too.\"... \"I gave up a lot for my dad; I have nothing to feel guilty about\".Putting yourself last for your dad was a loving thing to do. And... my hope is that you can also find different ways to help yourself feel \"good enough\" in this world, and a balance between caring for others and caring for yourself. :)", "topic": "grief-and-loss"}

This time, another guy came in and showed her attention. I'll forgive the cheating if she'll come home.", "answer": "I'm sorry that you lost your first born child. Death of a child always leaves a permanent reminder to the parents of a very painful time in their lives.The good news is your awareness that you and your wife are not connected in a satisfying way.There are many possible areas to examine in your relationship as partners and as parents.If what you write here are your observations and theories about your wife's outlook and conclusions, then the first step is to directly have conversations together on the topics you write here.What needs clarifying is what her reasons are for wanting to leave the marriage.Often, a crisis such as a child's death, motivates someone to look deeply into other intimate relationships. Keep in mind that looking deeply doesn't necessarily mean leaving the marriage.Also, be aware of your own frustrations and marital discontent. Be ready to talk about your feelings and uncertainties.There is no such thing as one happy partner in a marriage and one unhappy partner. Each person is part of a system and can only be as satisfied as their partner.The conversations that open relationship hurts and disappointments, hold a lot of emotion.

Have you considered speaking with a grief counselor? Being able to speak with someone that specializes in grief would be very beneficial. Do not get down on yourself for not recovering quickly. This is one of the hardest aspects to deal with in life but eventually you will be able to move forward. In the mean time, immerse yourself with positivity (i.e. Good friends, hobbies, exercise) and try to schedule a time with a counselor. Perhaps there will be a support group you could also join.

Will I ever stop crying? It’s been 3 years.", "answer": "I am sorry that you lost your mother. That is a really hard thing for someone to go through.There is really no set time for grief to be over, but I agree that if it has been three years and you are still crying every day then this is past the time for normal grief. I do not know how old you are and if you are in school or have a job, but I would imagine that if by now you literally were doing nothing but crying every day all day, someone would have noticed and would have gotten you some help. For one thing, bills have to be paid.There are typically five stages of grief and they can come in any order. You can go back to another stage that you previously experienced. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance are the stages. At first, people are usually in denial over the fact that they lose someone or are losing someone. This may mean that you deny they are ill or deny that they have actually died.Then comes bargaining, in which you may beg God that if you can only have this person back then you will do whatever. Depression is when the reality has settled in and when we cry and really feel the loss. It sounds like you are stuck in this phase.Finally, acceptance is when we accept that it has happened and we pick up the pieces of our life and move on.When we lose someone we never forget them. We may always have certain days that are tough, such as holidays or any special remembrance of your loved one. But we do get to the place where we accept that death is part of life and that it is inevitable, and that life goes on.A therapist can help you explore the reasons for your extended grief and can help you with coping skills to better deal with it. One suggestion I have is not to try to run from the sad feelings, don’t try to not feel them. Embrace the feelings. Let the feelings wash over you and accept them. Trying not to feel something is not going to help. Sadness is a part of life and needs to be felt just like happiness does. Unpleasant feelings are not to be avoided.I am sincerely sorry that you lost your mother and that you have had such a hard time of it for three years now. You deserve to be happy and to live a full life. I am sure your mother would not want you being sad for so long.

My guess is that you could sign him in as long as he met the criteria for admission at that moment, but I can't be entirely sure. You could also ask the person on the phone about financial responsibility. I have not heard of that being a problem, but I guess it would depend on insurance.If you have trouble finding a local hotline, consider calling the national crisis number (800-273-8255) and ask them to help you find someone local.", "topic": "substance-abuse"}
{"id": "counsel_00571", "question": "I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental. I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?", "answer": "Hi. Good for you in planning ahead to do what's healthiest for your baby (and yourself). That's a great first step! It's also good that you are able to identify that it's not always a physical need that's driving the addiction.For the next steps, I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur. The psychological (or mental) cravings are usually based out of habit, such as having a cigarette after a meal. And if you're consciously trying to quit, you'll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette, then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel, etc., etc. Well, if I'm on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer, eventually I'll give in and eat it.You're going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. That's normal and, for the most part, out of your control. But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. That's what you would have to work on changing. When you have that initial thought, acknowledge it (\"Ok, I kind of want a cigarette now.\"), but then change the thoughts that typically follow. Distract yourself, think about something else, do something else, whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.I've suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they're going to do when the time comes. Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. Eventually, it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it.Best of luck, and you have a really great motivator to quit - your baby!", "topic": "substance-abuse"}

Something like this, alcoholism, is a whole family disease. In other words, family members often unknowingly contribute to the alcoholism and enable the alcoholic to continue the destructive behavior.First of all, you can’t make your dad do anything, and constantly nagging him or begging him to stop is just going to make him defensive and make this worse. Nobody can change another person. What you can do is change how you react to him and the things that you and other family members do for him. Research codependency. There’s a great book called Codependent No More. There are a lot of articles on the internet that you can read. In short, you have to stop enabling him. Like I said, you cannot control him, but you can control yourself. This means do not buy his alcohol. Do not make it easy for him to get. Don’t loan him the car keys or pay any household bills for him. Don’t call in sick to work for him or make excuses for him in any way. Do not bail him out of jail when he gets arrested. He needs to be responsible for himself. This may mean losing his job or losing his driver’s license. This may mean that he loses his family if he doesn’t stop. What you and your family can do is set boundaries about what you will put up with. It is his choice to drink, but it is your choice to put up with the behaviors of his drinking. A lot of people go into rehab because their spouse said if they don’t then they are getting a divorce.If you are an adult and you don’t live with your dad, then the best thing you can do for him is STOP doing things for him. If you are a child who lives at home with him, then this could be a case for child protective services. In my state this is called DHS. A report is made to this organization for child abuse or neglect. Substance abuse in the home qualifies. Of course, alcohol is legal and when consumed in moderation, there is no problems. The problem will be the result of his alcohol consumption. Does he drive with children in the car while intoxicated? Is he left to care for minors while in an intoxicated state? Are there any domestic violence issues due to his drinking? This could be a reason for the authorities to step in. You can look for a local meeting for family members of alcoholics.

I wanted to share this video about coming out Coming OutI know it is hard when those we love do not accept us as we are. One thing to ask, is this something that you need their approval around? Owning who you are regardless of what others say sometimes helps. This may not be a part of your life you can share with them. We all have areas we have strong beliefs. Ideally, they would accept you no matter what but that does not seem to be the case. Deciding if this is a deal-breaker, or can you work around it, not sharing this part of your life, and understanding we cannot force people to embrace what they do not want to embrace. You get to live your life as you see fit and be happy. You deserve joy and to live authentically! If you are confident in your choice, choose your choice, own that, and set boundaries around it. You do not have to live your life for others. Loving yourself and being convicted in your choice regardless of others will be beneficial.

{"id": "counsel_00585", "question": "My mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned. She calls me every day complaining, but I don't want to hear it anymore.", "answer": "It is understandable that it's very hard for you to hear daily complaints from your mother regarding the caregiving of your niece. You cannot change your mother's feelings and responsibilities, which could create feelings of frustration and helplessness. It must be equally hard for your mother to assume full responsibility for your niece at a time where your sister cannot take care of her. This type of responsibility usually produces an enormous amount of stress and pressure because your mother and niece would both need to adapt to this new relationship, living situation, and the feeling of being \"abandoned.\" Not knowing the history of your relationship with your mother and how you respond to each other in times of need, it may be difficult to fight the right recommendation on how to deal with this situation. Nonetheless, it is not easy to have to face daily complaints and you may have to set a healthy balance between empathy and boundary setting with your mother and some personal boundaries for yourself. It is likely that your mother's \"complaints\" may be her desperate cry for help because she does not know how to cope with stress or how to ask for the right kind of support. In this case, you could calmly and respectfully tell her the next time you hear her complain, \"This must be very difficult for you because I hear the stress in your voice almost everyday. It's very hard for me to hear you feeling so overwhelmed. I feel helpless in this situation and would like to suggest that it might be helpful for you to seek some professional help and support to deal with such a big matter of importance.\" When empathy and understanding is communicated, recipients are usually more open because they hear and feel the caring behind it and are more likely to seek additional help.After sharing this message of empathy and encouragement to seek help, the next step is to protect yourself by explaining to your mother where your limits are so that she understands what she can expect from you. This means that you can decide the kind of support or help you are willing to give your mother and/or niece that is within your ability to provide without feeling overwhelmed. This could involve inviting them to dinner occasionally, taking them out to see a movie or inviting your niece over to give your mother respite. You could then say to her if she complains again, \"I cannot change the way you feel in this situation and I encourage you to seek professional advice about that but what I could do is .........(explain what you could do to help).\"www.PsychologyResource.ca", "topic": "family-conflict"}
{"id": "counsel_00586", "question": "After I told them, they yelled at me.", "answer": "Hello, and thank you for your question. I am very sorry that this was your experience with your family. I truly wish I could give you some things to say to them that would change their reaction, but unfortunately I can't do that. Their acceptance of you is a journey, just like coming out is a journey for you. Sometimes families initially respond this way, but after time they become more accepting and even supportive. Unfortunately, there is no way to know for sure if that will happen. So, here are a few things I would suggest:Surround yourself with people and things that remind you that you really are okay as you are. That won't take the place of your family's acceptance, and I won't even pretend that it would, but it may help during those days when it hurts the most. And that is really important. Patience is not something that many of us are really good at, but this type of situation sometimes forces you to have some. When families first learn something like this, they may go through a period of shock. And then sometimes even grieving. They may even be worried if they are of a particular religion where being bisexual is forbidden. These things can take time for them to reconcile, so it may just take some patience. If it is safe for you, try to talk to them, but if it becomes painful or hurtful then you have the right to walk away. I do recommend setting up some personal boundaries for yourself, and perhaps learn some assertiveness skills if you feel you struggle with them. The reason I feel that this is important is that people sometimes take a lot of abuse from family members and friends in times like you're describing. They may want to be accepted so much that they put themselves in hurtful positions over and over again hoping that their families will come around. They may, or they may not. And if they don't, you deserve to live a life free of abuse and to feel confident and assured of who you are. To be surrounded by folks who remind you of that. If you start seeing this pattern and you are struggling, chatting with counselor may be a great idea. I am bias probably, but I think chatting with a counselor is ALWAYS a good idea. :) Hope this helps. Be well. Be you. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC", "topic": "family-conflict"}

{"id": "counsel_00588", "question": "My mom is always bossy and treats me like a child even though I'm in my 20s. She argues with me over stupid stuff.", "answer": "This sounds like a pretty difficult dynamic and I am sorry to hear how it is impacting you.I would encourage you to try and observe the relationship from an outside perspective to begin with. Try to see what it is that causes your mom to be upset (such as you responding in a tone of voice she doesn't like) and see if there is something you could change on your end. If you are able to change something, like your tone of voice, start there. You could also try asking what you could do to help, perhaps she is frustrated that the trash wasn't taken out. You could also sit down and try to hash things out with her, if you feel like that could be beneficial.Ultimately, you are only in charge of you. The things you say, your behaviors, are all controlled by you. So it is important to recognize that no matter what, you can't control what she says or does. Obviously the things we say or do can impact others, which is why you are frustrated over her behavior. But remember that you are able to only control yourself. Seeking therapeutic intervention could also be beneficial for you, and even having her join in to help. I hope you are able to figure something out and I wish you well.", "topic": "family-conflict"}

{"id": "counsel_00590", "question": "My wife and mother are having tense disagreements. In the past, they’ve had minor differences. For example, my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing; my mother would complain my wife is lazy. However, it’s intensified lately. I think the cause is my wife talked back to her once. Now, any little disagreement is magnified, leading to major disagreements. What can I do?", "answer": "What you are describing is something psychologists have termed \"triangulation\" which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. You have been \"triangulated\" by your wife and mother.This is often seen in families. It's seen everywhere. How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. For example, I bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint.I'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. That's what therapists do every day! Sometimes just getting someone else's perspective can help you see the issue clearer. However, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love.If you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. Even if they really don't like each other and can't get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle. Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. I heard one mother-in-law describe her son's wife as the gateway to her son. The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. If your wife doesn't like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law's relationship with you and any children you two may have. From your wife's viewpoint, this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to. If you regularly praise your mom's cooking, her housework, gardening, or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated. This can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike. I am not saying that this is the case with your family's situation. These are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours. Regardless of what the cause is, if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue, your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you don't agree with them. They will get upset if you don't align yourself with them against the other. They will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other one's side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should. In worst cases, if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other, ending that relationship.

I did research and have identified myself as male but don't know how to tell my dad.", "answer": "I admire your courage.If you are concerned about telling your dad regarding your gender identity, I would suggest a couple of things. There are a lot of groups or other supports for people who are working through some of the same changes that you may be going through now. I don't mean to convey that everyone thinks, feels, or acts the same by any means, but rather that it may be helpful to talk to others who have had some similar experiences.I was trying to include some links for you, but that particular button isn't functioning window. If you search for \"transgender support\" on Google, you'll find GLAAD and PFLAG, both of which are national organizations. This does not mean that you have to identify as \"transgender,\" but researching that term may help you to find both national and local resources.As far as telling your dad, if that is particularly concerning for you, I suggest either talking through the details with a local therapist or considering if you have a trusted friend or family member (one who will respect your privacy with regard to who you would like to know about what you are experiencing at this time) so that you can talk with some people to have support. This may help with two things: allowing you to find some support for yourself as you work through the changes that you are going through now and also possibly talking with someone who knows your dad and may be able to talk with you regarding how or when to tell him.One thing that I tell anyone who wants to discuss something that is very important to them is to ask the person they want to talk to whether this is a good time for an important conversation. That way, you have greater chances of having the person's attention and/or not needing to end the conversation quickly.

Would it help for me to talk to someone about this?", "answer": "If the only way the relationship you have with your mother feels \"okay\" is when she is the only one who makes decisions concerning your life, then this only seems ok.In fact it is not okay for one person to be the authority for another person unless the one for whom this is being done, does not have their own ability to think for themselves.Separating your own wishes and way of handling life matters, from your mother's point of view, may be difficult.First, realize you need to get familiar with feeling at ease with the idea of deciding matters for yourself.You'll need practice until you feel comfortable.Unless, if you've been thinking through decisions you'd like to make and the idea of your mother's anger is the only point which stopped you, then you may almost instantly start living in a liberated way of running your own life.Basically, it is right and fair for you to have the chance to live your life the way you feel is best.

Your spirit is guiding you to stay put and recuperate from this ordeal, review for any signs you may have been more trusting than merited by the person's behavior.There's a natural flow to what we're able to handle and when we have renewed capacity for new adventures.There's no reason to assume that you'll never trust another woman again.

At times, it seems difficult to communicate with our family because many feelings and “undercover” messages are attached. Especially with our mothers, who often provide advice and feel responsible for us, it may feel like they are making everything about themselves as they express their worries and concerns.So what to do? First will be important to practice active listening skills, to ensure that you are receiving and understanding the message, without filtering it trough your own emotions or preconceptions of the person who speaks. Second, learn and practice assertive communication skills. Those will help you to communicate a message clearly and in pieces. It also emphasizes using I-statements to express how you feel at times when emotions become affected by the interaction. Third, you should practice, by writing your I-statement or role playing with your counselor. The trick with communication skills is that we need to practice them as often as possible until you to master them. You can also contact a family therapist to improve those skills if it becomes challenging, or contact a mediator if more issues arise.¿Cómo puedo lograr que mi mamá me escuche sin alarmarse tanto?La comunicación con nuestros seres queridos puede ser dificultosa, pero es la clave para mantener relaciones saludables y funcionales con ellos. A veces, nos parece aun más difícil comunicarnos con nuestra familia, porque hay muchos sentimientos y mensajes envueltos en la comunicación. Especialmente nuestras madres, pueden hacer parecer que están convirtiendo el asunto en algo personal, cuando se sienten preocupadas y responsables por nosotros y nuestras acciones.¿Y qué hacemos? Primero debemos aprender a escuchar activamente, para asegurarnos de que comprendemos el mensaje, y que no lo estemos filtrando a través de nuestras emociones e ideas de la otra persona. Segundo, aprende y practica comunicación asertiva. Esto te ayudara a comunicar un mensaje claramente y en pedazos. También te ayudar a aprender expresiones del Yo, para identificar sentimientos afectados durante la interacción. Tercero, es importante que practiques estas destrezas, ya sea escribiendo o con tu consejero. El secreto está en practicar las técnicas de comunicación cuantas veces sea posible, hasta que las uses espontáneamente. Si tienes dificultad aprendiendo estas técnicas, o el conflicto con tu mama es uno muy difícil de resolver, puedes contactar un consejero o mediador familiar para que te asista.", "topic": "family-conflict"}

{"id": "counsel_00618", "question": "My parents seem okay with other sexualities, but normally they only talk about being gay. When they do talk about bisexuality, they say things like “they'll do anything” or things that make me very uncomfortable because I am bisexual. I don't know if I am ready to come out to them.", "answer": "Hello, and thank you for your question. Being bisexual can be particularly difficult because it is often misunderstood, even by people who are “supposed” to be part of your own community, such as lesbians and gays. It happens so often that there is actually a term for it – bi-erasure. This is simply something that happens when people deny that bisexuality is a real thing, or discriminate against bisexuals due to beliefs like your parents seem to have. The unfortunate truth is that you can never be sure of how you parents may take this kind of information. It sounds promising that they are accepting of other sexual orientations, and it may simply be that your parents lack education about bisexuality. With accurate information, they may come around, but there is no way to be sure. Some of my colleagues have already given you good information. Here are some more things that you can consider and questions you can ask yourself before making the decision to tell them: 1. If they don’t respond the way you want them to, have you developed a support system to support you through it? This is very important. The truth is that all the friends in the world won’t prevent pain or sadness if your parents don’t respond as you hope, but they will at least be there to remind you that you ARE okay as you are. And that is critical for you to remember. 2. There is great information on the internet about bisexuality that you can offer your parents if you think it would be helpful. It may be important for them to know the kind of damage that is being done to bisexual adults and young people because of the myths surrounding bisexuality. Here is an article from GLAAD about bi-erasure: http://www.glaad.org/bisexual/bierasure 3. Coming out to people is obviously deeply personal and should only take place when you are ready. Sometimes people get pressured from friends, media, and even people they are romantically involved with to come out before they are ready. It really is up to you. If you are feeling pressure from others, don’t feel bad about setting your boundaries and telling them that you will come out on your own time. Intimate partners should respect you enough to understand this. 4. Something else to think about is your own comfort in being bisexual. Just because someone is LGBTQ doesn’t mean that they necessarily want to be. Many people struggle with this. Having your own doubts or insecurities may also play a part in how comfortable you are in telling your parents. So, perhaps do some self-exploration about your feelings toward yourself. Sometimes people take friends with them when they decide to come out to their parents. This is something you may want to consider. The important thing to remember is that you are okay. Really. If your parents don’t respond well, that doesn’t mean that they never will. Some start off upset, but then work their way through it. Best of luck to you. Robin J.

{"id": "counsel_00619", "question": "I'm in love with my own gender, and my parents are against that. I don't know how to tell them because I'm afraid they'll not want me anymore.", "answer": "Hello, and thank you for your question. This is one of those times when you wish you could assure someone that everything will go perfectly, but unfortunately I can't do that. There is no way of knowing how parents might respond until you tell them. The truth is that people have come out to their parents in many different ways. Some have told their parents directly, some drop hints, some have had others tell their parents, etc. The only \"right\" way to come out is the one that you choose. The one that feels right to you. That is the best way. Some people decide not to come out, and some wait for a very long time. Both of these things are okay. Coming out is deeply personal, and there can be real consequences to someone's emotional health and safety if they tell the wrong person. That is why it should only be done when you are ready. When you feel that you have the emotional and personal support that you need to take the risk. Sometimes people can feel pressured to come out, but I encourage you to do it in your own time. The truth is, there is a spectrum of how people's parents react to this kind of news. On one end, you may have the parents who shut a person out and are abusive, and on the opposite side you may have parents that are totally okay with it and throw you a \"Coming Out\" party. Most parents are going to fall somewhere in the middle. It is important to remember that their feelings may change over time. Many parents struggle at first, but they love their kids and get better with it over time. If you decide to tell them, consider taking someone along to support you. Plan ahead on what you want to say. It can be an emotional time, so do what you need to do to take care of yourself. If you need to, leave. You don't have to stay anywhere where someone is being cruel to you. I wish you well, and good luck.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC", "topic": "family-conflict"}

Stressors come in many forms and you are engulfed in a few of the major ones as it relates to dealing with the declining health of your father, family conflict, as well as trying to balance a work and school schedule. Stress, if left unchecked has many negative health related implications. First and foremost I would recommend going to see a counselor at your college/university. Most colleges have counseling centers for students that usually allow for 5-6 free counseling sessions (your tuition actually pay for these sessions so take advantage of them). Secondly I would advise you to take a minute and breathe. When confronted with overwhelming life issues it is common to busy ourselves in an attempt to distract ourselves from the drama, but sometimes that can compound our stress. When dealing with stress it is important that you engage in self care. In other words find time to engage in activities that bring you a sense of peace, enjoyment, and fulfillment in order that you may get a momentary release from your daily hectic life. Even with a normal life there is no way to escape stress, it is inevitable and a part of life, but how you deal with stress, as well as how you take care of yourself in the midst of these whirlwind events will determine your quality of life.

It's a dilemma; you want your dad to know how he's hurting you but you don't feel safe enough to say anything to him. Your reaction is understandable; it's his responsibility as a parent to work harder than you to create that safe place for you to be open. But that's not who your dad is. Your dad is your dad, and waiting for him to change won't really help. Nothing you do can change your dad, but...there are things you can do for yourself and your relationship with him. While your response of avoiding him is understandable, I wonder what effect it has on your dad. It's possible that he's feeling frustrated, rejected and punished by your withdrawal. You may think he knows that you're feeling hurt, but he probably doesn't. So this is the squirrel chasing its tail: your dad is rude, so your habit is to be silent, then he maybe feels abandoned and frustrated. His frustration comes out as more rudeness, which makes you want to withdraw more, and the cycle starts all over again. You can't change his part of the cycle but you can change yours.Are you willing to take a risk? Can you be honest about how you're feeling? What's the worst thing that could happen if you said to your dad \"You know why I avoid you? I stay silent because when I talk to you say rude things. So if you want me to talk, I need to know you can listen.\" I imagine it would come out differently because you're a few generations younger than me, but put that into your own words.I don't know the level of your dad's 'rudeness'. If he is abusive, then a better plan is to see a therapist alone or talk to someone about this. I don't want to put you at any risk. But if you don't worry your dad will hurt you, maybe give honesty a try.My point is that, as rude as your dad may be, checking out of a relationship by being silent is also rude. It's powerful...your silence. Your dad can't read your mind, and if you want things to be better you will need to get in that ring with him.And, if you're both open to it, seeing a therapist together can be really helpful. :)", "topic": "family-conflict"}

One of the hardest things about this, however, is getting both people within the relationship to recognize that they are both responsible for the successes and failures within the relationship and remove all the all-or-nothing blame. The best style of communication is open and asking for clarification; why not try asking your mother why this particular fight/situation is eliciting such an angry response.

It's sad that you're feeling excluded at Christmastime and family events.

How long has this part been happening? Has he always acted this way, or is it more recent? Did something happen recently? You mentioned doing \"stupid things to yourself\", and I don't know what that means. If you are engaging in self-harm he may be confused about what to do and he might need some time to think and be separate but is having trouble talking about this. Part of the problem, of course, is that you don't know what's going on for him. Certainly, you deserve the truth, and if he doesn't want to spend time with you, I would hope he would be honest. Have you been open to hearing the truth from him? Is there any reason for him to hesitate to tell you why he's being distant? Maybe you could ask him, if you are ready to hear.I'm glad to hear that you believe that you deserve a full, loving relationship, although it seems that moving forward might be difficult for you. Is it possible your happiness is a bit too dependant on this man? I'm just guessing, based on what you've said here.

When we feel that we are being talked down to or being ridiculed, it is difficult to not take it personally. It sounds like you have taken the first and necessary step in resolving this by bringing up the issue to him. Is it possible that the delivery of your message is causing him to feel blamed or defensive? Try communicating with him during a time when you are not upset and when it is out of context. Begin your statements with \"I\" as opposed to \"you.\" For example, you can tell him, \"I feel angry when you raise your voice at me\" instead of \"You always yell at me.\" Also, avoid using black and white terms such as never and always. Additionally, offer sugggestions as to ways that he can better communicate with you. Maybe he just doesn't know how to. Lastly, when delivering a message, I like to use the sandwich method by starting off the discussion with something postive and ending it with something postive. For example, you may say something to the effect of:\"Dad, I enjoy the discussions we share and really value your opinion. There are times that I feel angry when you talk to me aggressively. Perhaps you can try talking to me using a calmer tone when I bring up heated topics. Let's try and work on this together. I will try to be less sensitive and I am asking that you be more calm.\"I hope you find this useful!", "topic": "family-conflict"}
{"id": "counsel_00632", "question": "I am constantly having problems with the same two people who will always be in my life. I had a daughter with my ex-boyfriend. I am now married, and my husband’s ex-girlfriend is involved with my ex-boyfriend. They also have a daughter together. My issue is that there is always drama. I am pregnant, and I told my ex-boyfriend that I don't want any drama or arguments. I want to get along as much as possible, and he agreed. However, we just had an incident where my ex-boyfriend started discussing drop-off details about my stepdaughter. I told him that he needed to ask my husband because I can't make decisions about my stepdaughter regarding the matter. That led to an argument. I told him all my concern is when I pick up my daughter. My stepdaughter’s pick-up details are between my husband and his ex-girlfriend. I especially told him I didn't want to be involved. Somehow, he turned it around and then wanted to change the schedule we agreed on. He threatened me and got ugly because I wouldn’t discuss my stepdaughter’s matters with him. The point is there is so much drama. I try my best to get along with everyone. I don't understand where I went wrong (besides replying back to his question). I feel like I'm going crazy because this is a constant battle where everyone’s frustrations are taken out on each other, and it's the children that are hurting. I had a party planned for my daughter’s birthday, and my ex-boyfriend told me to cancel those plans because he wouldn’t let me have her. In my eyes, it’s the child that is hurting. I was throwing a party for her birthday, and because of the problem with stupid pick-up details about my stepdaughter, which I have no control over, he took it out on our daughter.", "answer": "Hi. I appreciate your mature instincts and strong efforts to draw clear boundaries in this very complex situation. I agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the children. Children need adults around them to act maturely, cooperatively and peacefully even when they don't like each other; it helps them feel secure and lets them focus on learning and growing. Your ex-boyfriend seems more focused on his own needs. In fact, he demonstrates behaviours that are aggressive, controlling and manipulative, bordering on 'parental alienation'. I agree this is a problem.I also appreciate how protective you are of yourself at this vulnerable time with the pregnancy. It's not unusual for pregnancy to trigger a need to conserve energy and reduce stress. Honour this instinct you have. I will suggest a few things to you. First, to gather support around you, professionally if you need it, from family and friends, and certainly from your husband. If you two are on the same page regarding the children issues and your ex, that will help. He can help run interference when it comes to his daughter. It will help you feel supported.Know that your ex's behaviours aren't happening because you did anything wrong; it's the way he operates (and maybe this is why you're not with him?). You can't change him, but you can stop blaming yourself for his immaturity and aggression. You're correct that he will always be there, and you can both accept this fact and also find ways to manage the situation.Keep on defining clear boundaries! You might sound like a broken record (\"You'll have to talk to my husband about that\"), but that's okay. It's okay to ignore his efforts to pull you into an argument or power struggle. It's okay to not respond to texts or other communications that aren't vitally important. It's okay to not let him into your house if it makes you uncomfortable. It's okay to not engage with him more than is necessary.Regarding his manipulative behaviours that reflect a tendency to keep your daughter from you, I recommend you document these behaviours and incidents carefully and fully. Let him know what your expectations are, simply and clearly and in writing (\"our agreement states X, and you are not following our agreement\"). Your daughter doesn't have to be aware; I think you already understand that she needs to be protected from the adult conflict.A professional therapist can help you with all of this. I hope this helps get you started towards greater peace, at least within yourself. :)", "topic": "family-conflict"}

It sucks to feel invisible and it is important that there is attention for you and that you know how much your mom loves and values you.

If that does happen I might dig hole in the ground with a paper that says \"here lays my emotions.

What's wrong with me?", "answer": "It sounds to me like you have had a lot going on and now you are afraid you are going to lose the last things you care about, your pets. I do not know what all is going on in your family, and I cannot answer for your dad’s actions or his reasoning behind this.I would recommend that you focus on developing healthy coping skills. We cannot change what others do but we can change how what they do affects us. If you have all of your emotions and all of yourself tied up into one thing (like your pets) then when that thing is taken away it causes a lot of emotional distress. It is really good to have a wide variety of interests such as friends, hobbies, games, etc. Develop other things that you care about and are passionate about.Another reason for developing healthy coping skills to deal with whatever might be going on in your life is if you don’t have healthy ones, you may develop some very unhealthy ones. You have to cope somehow, right? Developing unhealthy ways of coping with life is only going to make life more difficult for you.I don’t know if this is what it is like for you at your house, but there are two kinds of household environments that can cause dysfunction in children. One is when you grow up in a very rigid stern household where all decisions are made for you and you feel like you have no control over anything. The other is a household where things were chaotic and you never knew what was going to happen next and had no stability. People need to have some stability in their lives and need to feel in control over some things in order to feel safe.

Although I may not agree with a lot of the things he did he has updated his techniques a lot these days. FYI I kind of one of those interns back then who suggested because I know what I was dealing with during war time with military and my own marriage it wasn't his experience. Cause it is the energy pattern the way your environment IT is 101 basic communications and you will still maybe have those men who love to hear themselves talk and if you even try to talk they tell you to \" shut up\" which is abusive and that is another issue.

It DOESN'T necessarily mean, however that your husband is: gay, bisexual transgender, or even necessarily a cross-dresser etc. unless he has already told you so. I agree with the other poster who recommended you try and ask him more questions with an open and curious attitude and see if he might be open to explaining more with you. That being said, what we also know from research is that frequently what turns us on isn't always what we identify as. Lots of people have fantasies or even sexual behaviors they may enjoy from time to time without considering themselves to be a part of any label or subculture. For example, many women are okay with having their hair pulled or bottom spanked during a particular rowdy sexual encounter but certainly don't consider themselves kinky, submissive, or anything else. It could be that your husband enjoys pretending/ fantasizing that he is something completely different in the bedroom from time to time from what most other see him as outside in the corporate world or in other roles he plays as husband, father, son, friend etc. Many of my kink clients are drawn to their particular fetish simply because it's the opposite of what their life typically entails (e.g., a high profile CEO who is always responsible for making the decisions enjoys being at \"the mercy\" of someone else once a week). Each of us has a sexual script - a blueprint if you will of what we like and don't like in the bedroom and also what we have each come to see as being \"normal.\" It's also an internal guideline for how we each define our role in sexual expression, sexual orientation, sexual behaviors, sexual desires, and how big a part our sexual identity plays in our everyday lives (Gagnon & Simon, 1973).You've been clued into the fact that your husbands greatly differs from yours on the surface level at the moment. ALL of us are sexual beings yet none of us is exactly identical to one another in our sexual definitions and script expectations. It's like our own sex fingerprint. In my role as a couples counselor, I often help partners become aware of their own sexual script and explore where it overlaps their partners and where it may always differ. If a couple is able to successfully navigate formulating a plan for both to feel validated and sexually satisfied, the relationship thrives. Most counselors would agree that a healthy script includes:Both partners taking ownership for the couple's sexual experiences.Both partners learning to communicate openly and honestly about their feelings.Both partners learning to meet one another's - needs, desires, and wishes while making sure his/her own needs are being met.If \"pegging\" your husband as it's called is a hard and fast no for you, that will likely need to be respected as it may be too far off your own sexual script. However, if your husband is for sure absolutely adamant about \"needing\" to dress in a female fashion and/or be anally penetrated, you may seek professional counseling to help navigate how both of you will come to an agreement about fulfilling these desires in a way that doesn't hurt either one of you or the marriage.My warmest wishes to you both!", "topic": "marriage"}

Thousands of people are having this same feeling right now. I'm glad you're paying attention to it. When you first meet someone, there are all kinds of sparkly feelings and you both do and say lots of things to cement the attachment and create deep intimacy and connection. Then what happens is because we have that connection established, we instinctively cut back on those loving behaviours because we don't have to work hard to earn their love anymore. That sparkly feeling typically lasts a few years (long enough to procreate and keep the human race going), and then it wears off a bit, and you end up looking at each other thinking \"how come I don't feel the same anymore?\"Mostly (not always, and I'll get to that in a minute) all that this means is you've stopped doing all those loving things you used to do! It's as though you filled the car with gas, you've run out of gas now, and you're forgetting to put more in!The first clear solution to this feeling is to bring back more of your own loving behaviours that you've cut back on. Act lovingly, and you will likely regain those feelings. Talk to your partner about this. It's okay to say \"do you remember we used to do X,Y and Z? Can we do that again? Can I get more of the foot rubs you used to give me?\" Ask for what you want (instead of complaining). What are your 'love languages'? What are your partner's? Marriages need to be fed. It's that simple. Many things get in the way...children, jobs, but mostly complacency. Get active with your love!Okay, now, you might read this and think \"that's not what's happening\".

There are certainly more specific unique answers or elements for different people as far as the details, but here are some general ideas:Try to have at least 15 minutes a week where you are spending time together and not problem-solvingRealize that listening to your partner does not mean that you are agreeing with them, it just means that you are saying that you hear where they are coming fromLearn to hold on to your own wants, wishes, and desires while also recognizing those of your partnerSet boundaries for what is and isn't acceptable behavior during an argument or difficult discussionDiscuss how having important discussions can be anxiety-producing and consider having an understanding that if one of you (or both of you) feels overwhelmed, you can take a timeout for a certain amount of time.

Let's discuss it in an hour.\" And at that time, go back to the discussionConsider what your partner's top three or four complaints about you may be. Check in with them and see how accurate you are.

She is in denial and is trying to hide the truth, to protect herself. This is a natural behaviour. You don't indicate whether she wants the marriage, or is planning to leave. Which way you go from here depends in part on the answer to that question. If she wants the marriage, you certainly have the right to say \"I need answers to all my questions\". Giving you the information she needs has to be (if she wants the marriage) more important than protecting herself. I would support your right to advocate for all the information you need in order to feel secure or make decisions. She may fear that the truth will turn you away. If you want to, you can reassure her that you want the marriage no matter what the truth is. If the marriage is to survive, it needs openness.If, on the other hand, she's planning to end the marriage, then you might want to resign yourself to the fact that you may never get the information you seek. You are better off, in that case, seeking support from friends and family rather than beating on a closed door. Your wife has some decisions to make. Try to give her a bit of time to make them. You can patiently say \"I know this thing is happening. Talk to me so we can deal with it together.

If you're stuck in a particular pattern, and can start recognizing what happens between you when this pattern happens, then you can start to name it. Once you name it, then you can take a break to cool off and come back to each after your nervous system has had a chance to calm down (about 30 minutes). The key here though is to make sure you have a plan in place - when things are good between you - an agreement between you that when you both start to get escalated, you'll name it or have an agreed upon code word to signal you don't want to continue this cycle, and then agree to cool off and come back together at a later time.

If you felt in his heart that he was truly sorry for what he had done, it will give you a piece of mind that it was a mistake. Secondly, was he forthcoming with this information? How about with answering your questions after the truth was uncovered? If you found that he was still lying or not forthcoming, the sting is even more painful. He should be able to answer any question you have honestly and without hesitation.Thirdly, has he shown a positive difference after this experience? At this time, he should still be proving his faithfulness to the marriage, you and the children.Keep in mind that experiencing infidelity is a form of grief. It is not a quick process that can easily be overcome. What you are experiencing is 100% normal. My best suggestion would be to see a marriage therapist. Find out what drove your husband to cheat in the first place and decide if this aspect in his life has been resolved. I know its important for you to keep your family together but children can sense anger and frustration, this is not a healthy environment either. If you decide that you can no longer remain in the relationship, a therapist will also be able to help you cope with the separation along with addressing your children's needs.Please know that you are not alone and that unfortunately, many relationships have endured this very thing. It may also be helpful to reach out to people who have experienced similar obstacles. The web is a great resource to find groups whether online or in person to use as a support or sounding board.Best of luck to you and your family!", "topic": "marriage"}
{"id": "counsel_00652", "question": "I love him, but he doesn’t show me love. He talks badly about me to his friends.", "answer": "What you are describing is a state of abandonment like no other; a direct lack of respect. The challenge here is: you cannot control another person no matter how hard you try. The only person that you have control of is yourself. So then the question that this reality poses is: What are you willing to change? If you love yourself and know that you have tremendous value, if you can see what you bring to a relationship and that you deserve respect and love and tenderness, then you will get to a point where you will settle for nothing less than that. The change that might be necessary in yourself is to change the way you see yourself, the way you treat yourself and what you accept. Your husband also needs to change and that is something only he can do for himself but reaching out to get help as well. It would be helpful for you both to get help because there is damage on both parts. You have much more power than you realize and talking with someone can help you to hone that power and make a difference in your own life. Sometimes, the difference/change can be walking away from a bad situation or it can simply be changing your attitude and raising the bar. Sometimes our loved ones come with us on the elevation, and sometimes they get left behind. You must do some deep introspection through therapy to get to the point where you can answer this question for yourself.", "topic": "marriage"}

Obviously something has shifted which you do not understand. Therefore, perhaps you should consider attending Couples therapy to help work through your concerns and feelings? It would also be beneficial to assess if in fact any depression or other underlying issue is going on.

{"id": "counsel_00657", "question": "My husband and I would've been married for five years come June 2016. Our infant daughter just had her birthday. Shortly before, he told me he wanted a divorce. He has four other children, three of which are from his first wife. He decided to end that marriage when his youngest was an infant. The children do not have a good relationship with him now. He has another child from a woman he was dating. He decided he didn't want to be with her anymore when the child was an infant. It seems to me that there is a pattern. He easily detaches from relationships at the same time in the child's life but wants a relationship with them when they are older. I've tried to research online, but I'm not getting any answers. He also has an unhealthy dependency on alcohol and does not believe in mental health disorders such as depression and bi-polar disorder. He also does not believe in therapy or seeking help from professionals. Is there a detachment disorder or some form of mental block he could have? Where do you recommend researching this?", "answer": "This sounds really difficult and I can understand your motivation to get to bottom of why this behaviour has occurred - especially if your husband (who sounds like he is an ex-husband?) continues to have a relationship with you and your children. With that being said - relationships and mental health are very complicated and you are unlikely to find the answers you are looking for. In order for someone to be diagnosed with a mental illness or in order for them to identify what leads them to fall into particular patterns in relationship - they would need to be willing to seek help and honestly talk about their challenges, something that you say your ex is not willing to do.

Betrayal is very hard to get over so if it's taking you awhile to get over, know that this is normal.Hopefully you're husband has been very regretful and upfront and honest with you since this happened. It may take awhile to reestablish your trust with him and he should understand this. It's also very important to discuss WHY he cheated. You want to make sure that the reasoning behind this was not something that could arise again in the future. And if it can, there needs to be an action plan in place (i.e. being honest with how he's feeling) so that you both get a chance to rectify the situation.If the cheating has happened more than once, you may want to reevaluate your reasoning for staying in the marriage. It would be obvious that he did not truly regret what he had done or else he wouldn't repeat the same mistake. However, if it was a single event and he has shown you and continuously shows you that he genuinely loves you and is sorry for his mistake, I would give it a try. People do make mistakes and sometimes it takes an event like this to realize what you have.Know that it takes time and that you have the right to feel what you feel. If the relationship was a good, healthy relationship, it is worth saving. Ease back into it and be upfront with your feelings. In return, your husband should be patient and understanding of this.

{"id": "counsel_00659", "question": "I have been with my husband for almost 7 years. We got engaged a little after 5 years of being together. I had always been clear that I wanted to get married and I sadly would drop hints about how i wanted him to propose. When he did propose it was during a random vacation that I had planned. I was happy but I couldn't help feeling disappointed too. I had told him numerous times before that I wanted him to do it in front of my friends and family. I know it sounds dumb to be upset but I couldn't help how I was feeling. We are now married but the wedding and ring were also far from what I wanted and it wasn't due to lack of funds. I know this is all material and the marriage is the most important thing but I cant help but get jealous and envious every time I see someone get a proposal or wedding that I had wanted. I cant help my anger because I know we only get one proposal and one wedding. What I wanted will never happen. I have been working on my feelings for the past year and half to get over it. I try to focus on our marriage but every time I see someone have the best proposals and weddings I get upset. I know it is selfish and I know its petty but I just can't control it.

You may envy your friends' weddings but more than likely they had a few mishaps of their own and/or it wasn't as perfect as they had planned it either. However, like you know, the marriage is the most important thing. How many women are envious that you are in a happy, stable relationship? I assure you that there are plenty. Try to live in the present considering that dwelling on the past can still not change how you were proposed to or how your wedding day transpired. Focus on what you can control NOW. Perhaps, you can plan an extravagant renewal of your vows or change the look of your ring?I would also be upfront with your husband and explain why you've been short lately.

I binge eat and feel so overwhelmed with shame and disappointment that I end up going to the gym and trying to exercise the calories off. I am in my late 20s, and I have been dealing with this since I was a teenager. Are there any coping mechanisms I can use to break this cycle?", "answer": "Hello,This question describes a very typical setup of what is called the Binge, Repent, Repeat cycle. This means that typically after you binge, you experience emotions as you described \"shame and disappointment\" and then because of these emotions you \"repent\" (i.e. vow to never binge again, promise to \"do better,\" go to the gym, etc.) and then ultimately end up bingeing again. There are many coping mechanisms for binge eating and one of the best is actually attempting to NORMALIZE eating. Meaning you need to attempt to eat normally, eating appropriately portioned meals 3 times a day, with snacks in between. IF you binge, then it may be helpful to remind yourself that when you attempt to compensate for your bingeing behaviors, and you end up feeling restricted from over exercising or undereating, then this actually leads to a binge again. Thus, reverting you back to the cycle. If you binge, it will be helpful to try and get back on a normal schedule of eating instead of trying to compensate for the binge. Although it may feel counterproductive, getting back on a normal eating schedule will prevent you from entering into the restrictive cycle. It can also be helpful to remind yourself that the binge has already occurred, it is in the past and the goal is to move forward without focusing on the past. Focus on what you can do differently next time. What emotions or situations led up to the binge? What can you to do prevent or change the circumstances that led to the binge, or the way that you handled the situation? Lastly, if you're struggling with \"normalizing\" eating, it can be helpful to work with a professional that can provide counseling and coaching to help you learn how to eating normally, mindfully and without feeling the guilt and other harmful emotions sometimes associated with disordered eating.

{"id": "counsel_00664", "question": "I have no self control over food. Most people stop when they've had enough, but I keep eating for the pleasure of it. Especially with sweets - I'm never done eating dessert.", "answer": "Hello! I'm so glad you decided to write in today. This is such a great question and I'm sure many others will relate to exactly what you're describing. There are a few different ways we can look at in understanding your concern. First, I think it's important to understand food is just food. Food is meant to nourish our bodies, provide us with energy and yes, sometimes reserved for special occasions and celebrations. But in many cultures, we place a LOT of emphasis on food. We have food at every gathering and every celebration. What's more people have come to almost EXPECT food to be present at any and every get-together. And if it's not? Well, then forget about it! I see this time and time again with my clients. Donuts appear in the office, and it's almost like donuts have never been there before! Must eat one (or two)! However, we need to remind ourselves that this occurrence, or similar ones, will not be the last time we can enjoy this particular food. It is likely the office donuts have happened before, and they will be there again on another day. During these moments, I like to have my clients employ a Stop-and-Think method. Stop-and-Think about your goals before you eat. Is this donut getting you where you want to be? Also, I have my clients ask themselves how special is this donut? If the donut really is a special donut (from the best bakery in town and you've never been there before) then now might be a time to have the donut. But if not, it would be wise to pass and wait until that \"special\" donut. Another aspect we need to remember about food, is to think about what we're getting from overindulging or overeating. Are you trying to drown out other emotions? Are you trying to feel better and the food gives you that feeling for a brief moment? What ELSE is going on? This can be determined by utilizing what we describe as a Thought Record. A Thought Record involves tracking and identifying thoughts and feelings associated with food triggers. By targeting the emotions, we can then determine where they're coming from, as well as how to decipher them. A therapist can also help you with understanding your emotions related to food and will be helpful in assisting you with the Thought Record.The most important thing to remember is that \"food addiction\" can be a real problem for a lot of people. If food is taking over your life and you are preoccupied and overwhelmed with knowing where to start, please seek out help. Binge eating is the most common eating disorder and impacts the lives of thousands. There are lots of free resources and information on my website at www.maddenwellnessky.com.

I recently saw his phone and saw the people he texts the most and one of them was a female coworker. I don't know how to approach this situation. How do I ask him about it?.", "answer": "I agree with Sherry that in a close intimate relationship, you are entitled to ask questions about his relationship with significant others. These questions help couples to build connection and trust. It's based on the idea that if you reach out to him for whatever reason (support, openess, understanding, empathy), you can count on him and can expect him to be responsive. How he responds to your question will give you an idea whether he helps you to feel more emotionally secure and builds trust or if you feel that you cannot be open with him. If your partner responds in an open and understanding manner, it usually indicates that he cares about your feelings and values your importance. If he responds in a defensive manner, it could mean that he does not like that you are questioning your trust in him or that he has something to hide. Either way, you may wish to explain that building trust is something that is very important to you in a relationship and that talking to him openly helps to foster that. If he continues to be defensive or evasive, then there might be some bigger issues at stake and the two of you may benefit from couples counselling or having a discussion about the values that are important to you in the relationship and how the two of you will go about supporting those values with actions.Dr. Virginia Chowwww.PsychologyResource.ca", "topic": "relationships"}

He said he's not going to find someone else, but I'm afraid. How do I keep our relationship going?", "answer": "Hello. You are asking a very good question about how to sustain a long-distance relationship. Although maintaining a long-distance relationship has its challenges, with the proper communication, commitment, and understanding, many long-distance couples are able to thrive and maintain a close connection. Without knowing more about the \"complicated\" nature of your relationship, I wonder whether your boyfriend has given you reason not to trust him that makes afraid that he will find someone else. Has he cheated on you in the past and has shown romantic interest to another person that made you fear losing him? Or, is your thought just a fear but not based on evidence? Knowing that distinction is important because if it is the latter, you may benefit from refocusing on the wonderful qualities about your partner that makes you feel good about him and the relationship rather than focusing on the unknown or uncertainty of the future. The more you focus on \"what if\" situations, the more you may feel anxious about a reality that is not accurate and make you act in ways that are insecure. However, if there is reason for you to question his fidelity, you may have to speak to your boyfriend about how to build trust in the context of a long-distance relationship. To help the conversation, you may need to consider what you may need to experience or receive as support to feel safe in the relationship to build trust. Is that you wish him to contact you regularly, or to include you more in his life, or to make a clear commitment? For many of my clients in my private practice, that may include talking to their partner often and using a variety of modalities including text, phone, and Skype. It's hard to believe in a relationship when you never talk to your partner, and it's hard to build a relationship when you don't know what's going on in your partner's life. Other times, it is Making sure they talk often to their long-distance partner so that they can participate in each others lives and to feel their presence.. Regular communication, understanding and caring is the key to sustaining any relationship, but this is especially true for long-distance ones.

This made my girlfriend really suspicious. She would ask me why I wouldn't ever answer that phone number. I told my girlfriend that I don't want to be friends with that other woman, but I don't think she believes me. How can I get my girlfriend to understand?", "answer": "We women really do tend to struggle with the comparison game. And Hollywood culture hasn't helped with romantic comedies and song lyrics telling us that when a man appears evasive, there's something to worry about. It's been my clinical experience though that most women value transparency and security in their relationships. So you might try sharing a little bit more about your history with this woman. For example:Where did you meet her?How long were you friends before you decided to call it quits? Why don't you want to be friends with her (i.e., what do you mean by \"kind of crazy\")? I promise this tends to matter to women.Were you ever intimately involved with or even attracted to her?If your girlfriend can truly see that you view her as the filet mignon to the other woman's hamburger, and that she is your favorite person on the planet and has NOTHING to worry about, she may start to come around.Now, IF she's more concerned that you might be taking this woman's calls behind your back, while I'm not typically a huge fan of sharing passwords or phone records, you might print them off and highlight this female's number and show your girlfriend that you absolutely are telling the truth.And if you really want to step it up, I would be intentional about doing all the little things that you know your girlfriend loves that helped make her fall in love with you in the first place (e.g., little love notes for her to find or sweet text messages, buy a rose or her favorite flower, have her car detailed, do the laundry...date nights...you get the idea). Bottom line - show your girlfriend why out of all the women on the planet that you could be with, you CHOSE HER. And would continue to do so all over again. AND why you love HER as a person.

Everything else is perfect about him, but I find myself lusting over more attractive men. The next step is marriage, but I want to marry someone who I can wake up to and fall in love with all over again. However, I also don't want to throw away a great relationship over what might just be lust. Am I asking for too much in the \"perfect guy\"? Is there such a thing? Am I truly in love?", "answer": "The basic guideline for relationship satisfaction, is to know what you can and cannot live with and without. And, since you are considering marriage, for how long do you imagine yourself being satisfied living with and without certain qualities of your partner.There is a hard wired dynamic between two people that defines the basic structure of the relationship.While life is filled with surprises and can change in an instant, the basic way in which the partners of a couple, connect.Do you understand why you are not attracted to your partner? Whatever the reason, now is a good time to state this about yourself. He may be quite willing and interested in developing new ways of sexually stimulating you. Maybe he is just as shy about talking about this topic as you are. On some level he must know that he doesn't satisfy you. He may be relieved to hear you bring up the topic!As always, remember that if discussing a relationship matter feel hard to start, consider utilizing therapy services with a professional, credentialed and licensed therapist.", "topic": "relationships"}
{"id": "counsel_00675", "question": "I've been with my partner for 4 years. She's given me no reason not to trust her. But lately I've been overreacting a lot when she's just doing normal things. I think it's triggering my bad past relationships. How can I get rid of these insecurities and be more trusting with her?", "answer": "What's most important is that you recognize that what you've been doing is off base - that what you've been feeling is \"overreacting,\" that you have \"insecurities,\" and you suspect your actions and reactions are connected to your own past and not to the current situation or to your partner. That's an excellent first step because without recognizing these things about yourself, it's unlikely that you would change.That said, you sound as if you are really ready to start some therapy to work on your own personal growth... not because there is something \"wrong\" with you, but because you're ready to learn more about yourself and make some creative changes in your behavior. Yes, there are lots of self-help books and courses, but we humans often make the most progress when we have support in real-time from another human being who can sit with us, point out our blind spots, and teach us some skills that are hard to learn on our own.", "topic": "relationships"}
{"id": "counsel_00676", "question": "However, it seems as though he is really talking to someone other than himself. I have even accused him of having a secret phone. Is he trying to make me crazy on purpose, or is he really talking to himself?", "answer": "Some people simply talk to themselves as a way of processing information. Have you checked in with your husband about this in a non-accusatory way? Something like \"Hey babe (or whatever sweet name you typically use), I'm so curious what that's all about? Do you notice that you are talking out loud?\" Chances are it's just how he thinks things through and is not at all about trying to make you crazy, it's just one of his quirks you'll grow to endear.

I spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend. Was i wrong?", "answer": "💕 They say three can be a crowd. First ask yourself how you felt when you were with this friend that weekend? Did I feel uncomfortable and was I thinking of my boyfriend the whole time? Did I communicate with my boyfriend that weekend while with my friend?

{"id": "counsel_00678", "question": "I'm dating a guy I really love. We have our problems, but I could see myself with him long term. But there's this other guy who I've had feelings for for awhile now. He gives me butterflies when we talk, and my heart beats fast when I see he's texted me, which i never felt with my current boyfriend.", "answer": "There are different types of attraction. You said that you've never felt this sort of feeling of your heart beating faster with your current boyfriend. Depending on how long you've been together and if you're looking at different ways of making a life together and getting to know each other on a deeper level, that's a different stage in a relationship and sometimes it feels different. Some people look at it as a difference between levels of passion and compassion, but there are many different terms to try to talk about it.Perhaps with this guy that you really love, you could talk about ways to keep things new and different in the relationship. Maybe you can leave notes for each other during the day or have a small surprise at random intervals (maybe an invitation to a picnic, for example).As for the other guy who makes your heart beat faster, what do you see in him? You said you really love the other guy, which is why I'm asking.What do you look for in the person who you want to be with long-term (whoever that is)?", "topic": "relationships"}
{"id": "counsel_00679", "question": "My ex-boyfriend and I have been back and forth for over a year now. He's in his late 20s, divorced for like five years now with two kids. He has a lot of narcissistic behaviors. He lies and cheats, but I love him. I've tried to date other people, but I always go back to him.", "answer": "Try to figure out why you go back to him.Love is never enough reason to sustain a relationship.Though your love may feel and be very real, the fact of the frequent breaks show that some quality or dynamic within the relationship is not satisfying enough to sustain the two of you.Always people are better off with some time separation between relationships. This gives a chance to know what you were looking for and din't find in the ended relationship.Dating other people before you have time to understand what did and didn't work well in a relationship, will make the new dates seem like a lacking comparison to the first guy.Also, lying and cheating are very demoralizing. Maybe your higher self tries to take you out from this situation and you first need to strengthen your spirit in order to follow your own best interest.", "topic": "relationships"}

He is isolated from everybody, and I want to help, but I cannot find him.", "answer": "If you mean he has been reported to police as missing, then this is different than him deciding to make himself unavailable to you and others.If the police cannot find him, then there is a level of risk or secrecy to his whereabouts beyond someone simply shutting themselves off temporarily from others.The best you can do is self-comfort from the surprise and possibly shock of his behavior.From your description, whether or not he reappears is up to him returning or up to police skill to locate him.This is beyond the ordinary abilities of average everyday people, even those who are involved relationship wise with someone.", "topic": "relationships"}

I understand what she did was wrong, but I want to spend the rest of my life with her. So I'm willing to forgive and move on. We have been together for a little over 9 years, and we have a son. At the beginning of our relationship, I was unfaithful and she caught me cheating. She forgave me for what I've done to her and since then I been completely faithful. I'm worried about our relationship and want to move forward but its been very unsettling. All I can think about is her with another man. I don't know what to do or where to go for advice?", "answer": "I'm sorry for the stress and unhappiness stemming the problem you describe.Trust your instinct that there is more complexity to feeling good about being in a partnership than simply wanting this to happen.In any relationship, the complexities of each person combine. Often people accept when this feels good and are lost as to what to do when natural human complexity, doesn't match up with our partner in the way we'd like.A couples' therapist would be able to help each of you talk about the factors motivating the cheating, as well as clarify the reasons you each have for continuing to stay together. The unique advantage of couple's therapy is that each person is able to hear their partner talk out loud about themselves and their partner.This is sometimes enormously helpful since our inner thoughts are often hidden yet very dominant in how we direct ourselves in relationships.Sometimes the initial consult session offers enough new understanding that a second session wouldn't be necessary for a while.Good luck in finding your relationship happiness!", "topic": "relationships"}

The man I love is their father, and no matter how many times things haven't been great in the past, I can't help but love him. I know they both love me, and I love both of them.", "answer": "The answer depends entirely on which interest is stronger for you.If the reliable caretaker man is not someone with whom you'd have fun, lively conversations, understand each other, be sexually compatible, or romantically attracted, and your primary interest is in someone who' steadily manage the kids, household, and finances, then he is the right one for you!The problem is you may not be happy longterm with someone to whom you feel no romantic compatibility. Consider the drawback if you reach the moment of restlessness romantically and are with someone on whom you depend to take care of your kids.Since you have feelings for him, then wait several months longer to see whether or not you can imagine yourself romantically happy with the steady guy.If the other guy who is also the bio dad, isn't involved with his own kids, then he seems like a poor choice of someone to be with longterm.", "topic": "relationships"}
{"id": "counsel_00683", "question": "I have had a crush on this guy for years. I last talked to him a few years ago when we graduated from high school. We left off on a good note. Should I message him and see how he is doing, or is it too late?", "answer": "You'll only find out whether or not it is \"too late\", by following through with wanting to message him.Regardless of whether the response you receive is what you'd hoped to hear, including not hearing back from him, you will have done yourself a great honor and respect by following through on a wish and curiosity you've had for some time.", "topic": "relationships"}
{"id": "counsel_00684", "question": "There's this boy who asked me out awhile ago. I said no because my friends and family would think weirdly of me. How do I be with him and tell him and tell my friends?", "answer": "Since you've decided to be with the boy who already showed you his interest, then why not simply tell him you decided to accept his invitation to be together?Probably your first concern about hesitating to accept this boy into your life due to the way you imagine your family may react if you do, is the more complex matter to solve.Forming a relationship does bring up our values and the way these are different or similar to our own. At the same time, we already have values which are rooted in those from the family in which we grew up.Your dilemma of wanting to be with this boy shows there is a clash between your values as an individual, including your choice of partner, and the way your family understands the values which support being part of a couple.Stay true to what you feel, whether this comes from your family or the way you currently are evolving.This will guarantee that your new relationship will be built on the values and person you truly are.", "topic": "relationships"}

I question everything he does from loving me to if my body is good enough. I'm super jealous for no reason, and my temper is super short. He's pretty much done. He said I have a bit more than a week to fix it.", "answer": "Are there ways your partner acknowledges the difficulty to stabilize the questions you ask about your self-worth?Your questions are typical for anyone who feels insecure and unsure. The lack of confidence you feel exists in many other human beings too.Your partner's wish for you to feel better about yourself, is fine. The problem is he seems more interested for you to solve the problem for his sake than for your sake.As long as he considers you an obstacle to his happiness, and not someone he loves and would like to help improve their inner stability, then he doesn't offer you more of his self-interest than of his love.A week is an unrealistic timeframe to cure the subject you describe.Any time line misses the point of how humans evolve and not automatically change.He also is either missing or isn't interested, in supporting your emotional progress.", "topic": "relationships"}
{"id": "counsel_00686", "question": "About two and a half months ago, I met a woman on a dating site. We went out on two dates, and then despite her original plans on how to pace and conduct the relationship, I ended up at her house on a the Friday night one week after our first date. We respectfully tried not to have sex, but after hours of trying to resist each other, we gave in and we had sex. After that, I slept at her house every night for almost two weeks. Then one day, she went to her family’s house on Thanksgiving and everything changed. Within the short time we were together, we got so close and serious really fast. We had finally found each other. We told each other that we loved each other all the time, even while we were making love. A few days after Thanksgiving, she told me that we would have to go back to her original plans of seeing each other much less frequently. I was very hurt and didn’t understand. Then another week later, she told me she couldn’t do it at all anymore. I was crushed! A few days later, she tells me how much she’s missing me and “let’s get together for lunch” or something like that. Then about two weeks later, we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other (in love, not just sex), but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her. So for her child’s sake, she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen. She had told me all about him previously, and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him, but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child. Our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged, but she is torn and confused. She doesn’t even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly. I know she needs time, and all I can do is take care of myself. We have agreed to remain friends, and if this doesn’t work out for her, we will try again. I’m completely in love with her, and I’m in extreme pain.", "answer": "That sounds really heartbreaking. It is tough falling in love and not being able to dive fully because of complications on the other side. It sounds to me that you are doing exactly what you need to be doing by taking \"care of myself\" while the rest sorts itself out. While I admire your desire and courage to stay friends - the \"extreme pain\" that you mentioned may make this too challenging and at odds with your taking care of yourself. Since there is no commitment on her end to give it a shot with you I would make sure that you really honour your own feelings about what feels right to you so that you don't end up feeling strung along or resentful. Make sure that you lean on friends and family at this time - we need all the support that we can get when we are heartbroken.", "topic": "relationships"}

{"id": "counsel_00688", "question": "I'm having relationship problems and I want to fix them to make things right before I lose her. How can I learn how to listen and get myself together?", "answer": "What an important question, and the fact that you're asking it is a big step in the right direction. To answer in detail would require having quite a bit more information about what \"relationship problems\" have occurred that woke you up to the fact that you're not listening as well as you could and that you're running the risk of losing her.Given that I don't have all that information, I'll offer one simple suggestion. Your girlfriend is the expert on what she needs and wants in relationship. You could simply say to her that you know you still have a lot to learn about how to have a good relationship and you realize you're not yet understanding what she needs and you really want to. Then take a deep breath, settle down, and listen. Don't argue, don't interrupt, don't judge... listen. Let her know what you understand and that you're open to hearing more, learning more if you're not quite getting it yet... and then listen some more. Be present and curious about this person you love dearly and don't want to lose. This is the first step toward intimacy.", "topic": "relationships"}
{"id": "counsel_00689", "question": "Recently my boyfriend broke up with me because of my bad language. But he thinks I'm a total b***h. I know I'm bipolar and can be selfish. He called me today and says he can't go through with the breakup. I was broken and didn't want a breakup to begin with, but I know I'm horrible at times and can't help it. It's like I'm battling myself. What do you feel?", "answer": "Both options seem reasonable. Seeking individual therapy will help you to cope with the mood changes that come with bipolar disorder, will give you a space to vent your negative thoughts, and will allow you to find the coping mechanism to address life and relational challenges. IF your boyfriend is interested in attending couples therapy with you, it will assist in identifying the problems in the relationship that pushed him to the breakup and will give both of you the tools to communicate and resolve conflicts.I am a Licensed Professional Counselor in Texas, currently providing individual, couples, and family therapy services in West Houston.

Yo estaba destruida y no quería que nos dejáramos desde el inicio, pero se lo horrible que puedo ser a veces y que no lo puedo evitar. Es como si estuviera en guerra conmigo misma. ¿Qué piensas?Ambas opciones son razonables. Buscar terapia individual te ayudara a manejar los cambios de estado de ánimo que son partes del desorden bipolar, también te dará espacio para ventilar los pensamientos negativos y encontrar herramientas para enfrentar problemas relacionales y de la vida diaria.

We had a very good and friendly relationship, and we seemed to have a lot in common. I never gained the courage to ask her out.", "answer": "One way to make good use of the situation you describe is to prepare and rehearse within yourself the way you'd handle a similar situation in the future.Since a lot of time has gone by since you and this girl saw each other on a regular basis, right now you've got no idea if you'd feel the same way about her today as you did a few years ago.The relationship does point out the priorities and values you hold for a potential partner. That you liked the friendliness you shared is good for you to recognize. This way you realize you like friendship as a relationship property. To have lots of similar interests, is another quality you appreciate in a partner.The more you know about what you do and don't like in a partner, the greater your chance to notice these qualities in someone new who comes along your path.", "topic": "relationships"}

I don't know what to do to fix the relationship.", "answer": "My empathy goes out to you. Relationships are tough enough and i'm sure your partner being distant has been upsetting for you. You are confused and want to mend the relationship with him, but are finding it so hard to do. Relationships require both people to work consistently in order to keep them happier, but if it is only you that is actively trying to repair the relationship, it can be emotionally draining. Perhaps expressing you feel using I, you statements can be beneficial. Do not accuse him or use \"you\" statements like \"you are so distant\" or \"you don't even care\".Start out sharing your feelings by saying \"I feel sad when you don't return my phone calls\" or \"I feel confused about our relationship ever since you have been keeping to yourself\". He may have a valid point, or might have been hurt by the argument and retreated as a result of it. Regardless of why, use this time as a great opportunity to practice healthy communication. If you think you are not ready for a conversation like that, couples counseling can be excellent. You will have a skilled facilitator guide the conversation and help you both communicate with one another.", "topic": "relationships"}

Is there a reason no one sparks my interest?", "answer": "Yes, of course there's a reason!There's always a reason for most dynamics!Depending on the nature and qualities of what changed as a result of your new self realizations, you may be more deeply affected by your new awareness than how you imagined these would go.Since you already are on the best road possible for yourself, since this resulted from your own introspection, keep trusting your own self work as to what develops and at what pace your relationship attraction qualities grow.", "topic": "relationships"}

I want to get back together but he won't talk to me. What should I do?", "answer": "Probably being sad to lose the relationship would be a good next move for you.When a relationship ends the daily life structure changes significantly. A break up means adjusting to differences in everyday life, not only that the person is no longer connected with us.Since your boyfriend isn't talking to you then you're keeping yourself sadder than necessary to not accept his actions. There's nothing you or anyone else can do change the fact that when someone decides to stop talking, this person is the only one who's in charge to start talking.Maybe since you've had several breakups w this person that you require more time to pass before you're willing to accept that his changed interest in the relationship is permanent.Be patient with your uncertainty as to whether he will or will not resume the relationship. Once enough time passes so that you're considerably past the point at which you and he come together, then accepting his leave-taking will feel natural.Right now its very understandable to have hope since you've been on this road before.

What do I do?", "answer": "Do you and the brother to whom you feel attracted, ever see each other or are in surroundings in which the sister/your friend, isn't?If yes, then this gives you the chance to find out whether you and the brother actually do like each other.If no, then definitely have a private and direct conversation with your friend about the fact you're attracted to the brother.Find out the reason your friend becomes angry to hear you like the brother.Anything is possible from, she'd like to warn you about qualities in her brother which you may not know and if you did, wouldn't like or react negatively.Or, if protection isn't your friend's reason, then maybe she's fearful to lose your friendship if you start a relationship with the brother.Friends are people who care about each others' lives.

How can I fix this relationship?", "answer": "A key factor in a relationship is trust.I'd start by understanding more about why you feel unable to trust your bf.Does this have something to do with a bad encounter you had from previous relationships, or with a sibling or parent?Its also possible you're intuitively sensing you can't trust your bf bc he's not trustworthy. Sometimes people sense the basic safety items in a relationship before they emerge.Also, your bf may have similarly suffered broken trust and he gives off a feeling of not welcoming your trust.Its possible you're feeling his own self-protection about being in a relationship with you.The best way to open these topics is to actually talk about them together with him.Whatever the underlying tensions are, talking about them always adds positive feeling and confidence to a relationship.", "topic": "relationships"}

How can I get him to understand?", "answer": "Well, have you told him similar descriptions of your feelings as you just wrote here?This will give him the same understanding you're allowing us to have here on this site.Keep in mind that the best, the amount and the number of times you tell your boyfriend some information about you, still means that whether or not he is willing to accept and rely on your information, is in his hands only.Try to feel satisfied with your own effort to explain yourself.

Loneliness contributes to feeling overwhelmed too.Your feelings may be perfectly normal.Similarly, depending on what you mean \"take it out on\" people, you may be expecting too much of yourself.If you're expecting other people to listen to your upset feelings, this is reasonable.If you're harming them as a a result of your upset feelings, this is unreasonable.Depending on what exactly you are doing when you \"take it out\", you may be quite reasonable to do so.", "topic": "relationships"}

If most of the time you trust the sense you are loved and you love him, then this gives you some reassurance about how the both of you feel toward each other.It is possible too that your finance has some remaining feelings for the ex.

Arguments have arised from this single issue many times.", "answer": "Do you know what you're afraid may happen if you do speak up?Usually people don't talk freely because they feel afraid to do so. Sometimes the fear of being rejected by the other, of being criticized or judged by the other person, or that what you will say stirs anger in the other person.If you are able to know what your particular reason is for not talking, then maybe you and your partner can talk about what makes talking easy or hard.Also, since speaking up is new for you, then ask your partner to be patient while you learn to do so.

So, while you still look like grown ups, your actions and words are motivated by very early preverbal parts of both of you. In simple terms it is as if two infants somehow acquire the ability to say words but they are motivated by very basic early wounds that were created due to deficits in what was able to be done for each of you, and likely understandable in terms of caregiver's life experience, and that still fell short of what you needed. You are both still trying to get very early needs met. The best advice I can offer is to try and remember this as early as possible when things start to heat up, and then restrain expression that you already know leads nowhere helpful.

The dynamics of having a romantic relationship with someone is not always clear. Sometimes we jump from one relationship to another without giving ourselves a chance to adjust and grieve for the one we had to leave behind. When you find yourself in a situation where a previous partner is coming back into your life and desires to be with you again, it is important to ask yourself what the motivations are prompting that return. Is the person afraid of being alone? Are they jealous of your current relationship? Do you feel the same way about this returning relationship as you did before it was ended? How long and/or how committed is the current relationship you are in now with your current partner? Does your former partner not like being \"dumped\" and maybe they just want to get back together with you so that they can \"dump\" you instead? Some of these questions you may not be able to answer, and some of them might require your own internal reflection.You likely want to make a good decision, and you also might want to consider who it will impact, and how that will happen. Other friends might be upset at this sudden change, and it could create a strain on your friendship. You will want to carefully consider the value of that friendship before you take any actions that could damage it. Also perhaps think about what led you to end the relationship with your previous partner in the first place. Has there been a change in events or behavior that would cause you to think of a valid reason to give that person a second chance? How it will it impact your current relationship?Going into relationships should be done with reflection, patience, and full awareness. Ultimately you choose who is in your life, so you want to make those choices based on appropriate decision making, and with the ability to protect yourself from harm. No one else can make this choice for you. However, gaining the insight of friends or family can be helpful, as can seeking out the counsel of a therapist. In your heart, you will likely find the right answer. Learn to trust that more, as that is where the core of emotion tends to be when you need it. Use your mind to analyze things, but allow yourself to also feel your way through the situation too. The answer will arrive if you let it.", "topic": "relationships"}

The ability to listen considerately to your partner and to have your partner listen to you is one of the keystones of a successful relationship.

How do I get away from this relationship?", "answer": "I'm glad you recognize your own best interest and that your life will be much better without verbal and emotional abuse.One of the terrible results of being abused in a relationship which is expected to be loving, safe and supportive, is that the one who is being abused, starts to question their own judgement, rights, opinions, overall way of thinking.This happens because partners who are intimately involved with one another are very meaningful. Regardless of how irrational, wrong, mean, selfish, intimidating, thoughtless, a partner is to the other, the person on the receiving side gradually starts questioning whether they are wrong for not accepting these sorts of interactions.Stick with what your own intuition tells you.There is a part within each of us which knows the truth of what is going on.Leaving a relationship is always difficult to some degree. People are in familiar patterns of daily behavior, no one wants to suddenly \"be alone\", even if this only means showing up as a physical body, not as a truly loving partner, no one wants to start telling others about a breakup, answer questions about it, feel blamed, worry what others think.These are secondary matters to following the truth in your own heart.Listen to yourself about leaving this guy.

I started freaking out if he did not answer, thinking that something bad happened.", "answer": "People often care deeply for those whom they love. I don't know how long you have been together. It is also common to want to be very closely connected to people who are important to you.It may be helpful to have a conversation about talking more or talking about how you feel when he is not there and how he feels about answering you right away. It may be helpful for both of you to listen to each other and what you are feeling and experiencing so that you can look at what may work for both of you. For example, maybe you could remind yourself that he will answer you when he is not busy or as soon as he can.Sometimes just talking about these feelings can be helpful so that you can both have open discussions about whether the amount or type of communication is too much or in a style that is not working for both of you. You could also consider leaving text messages or something that does not require an immediate response so that when he is busy, you have the ability to write a message, and he has the ability to answer when he can.I also wonder where you are getting the idea that something bad happened. I don't know whether something happen with this person in the past or perhaps at another time in your life.Some people benefit from ideas such as not going to bed angry, but this is difficult for others.I would suggest considering what makes each of you feel loved, valued, appreciated, or special.Also think about what styles of communication you both like and what is and is not okay in the context of an argument.It may be difficult to talk about what has related to him being distant and it may be helpful to talk about ways to communicate about this first (such as taking a 10 minute timeout if it becomes overwhelming).Perhaps talking with a therapist who specializes in couples would be helpful if talking about this between you is confusing or if you do not both feel heard by the other person.

It sounds a bit as though you are trying to read each other's mind without being able to communicate effectively.

Is that really okay?", "answer": "Hi, First and foremost, I want to acknowledge your efforts to gain (your) ideal erectile function. If the medications are not working and you have taken them as prescribed, I would encourage you to seek the help of a sex therapist as the dysfunction may be due to a psychological and/or relational issue rather than a physical/medical one. As for your question, only you can answer this. Is it OK? Are you OK with her sleeping with others? Have you thought through what this may look like, feel like, become for you and her? Opening up a relationship is a choice only the people in the relationship can answer. Even then, the answer may change at any point by either of you. I encourage you to also determine what the intention is underneath your telling your girlfriend she could sleep with others. Be clear with the intention and then together have continuous conversations about the expectations of opening up (i.e.: are there any kinds of sex that is off limits, areas of the body where touch or intimacy is not allowed, are uses of safer sex required or not, do you want to know the details or not, so forth).

I get the sense that this relationship isn't working for you, but for some reason you're stopping yourself from being honest with yourself and him and just ending it. In the early stage of a relationship (the first year), if it doesn't feel fabulous, it's a good idea to move on. It's not personal. You don't owe this person anything.

Leaving is not the answer after a \"big argument\" as you mentioned. However this is not surprising to me based on his possible age and maturity level. Having a baby is a lifetime responsibility and there are very few who handle this or who realizes that it requires one to step their game up.

Hopefully, someone who has better (wise) advice will talk to him and he will listen.As for you, how do you handle this situation is your question....you do what you have to do to prepare for your baby, with or without him. A lot can happen in four years and you don't have time, are not required, and can't wait to see what will happen with him. You have a LIFE to prepare for, to feed, to protect, and to love.

You know, I meet with a lot of people who are so sick of the crap that their ex puts them through in the divorce process that yes, they wonder if it's best to go back. I don't think so.If your ex is using the children to manipulate, or is generally controlling the separation process, that's confirmation that getting out was the right decision.Your partner feels powerless to change the current situation. Of course he does, because there are many things that are beyond his control (his ex's behaviours, for one). Accept the powerlessness. Lean into it. It's okay, because there are many things he does have power over, and that's where he can focus. He has the power to give his children a happy dad. That's HUGE. That's why he left, I'd guess. I bet the main barrier to him being happy is the guilt he feels. That's his ex's voice...that's what she wants him to feel...to give into that is letting her win.

Hopefully he's aware that the separation has affected them and he's working to create peace and balance in their lives, but he's can let go of the shame she wants him to feel; it's crippling him.He has the power to separate emotionally from his ex. He's not doing that when he lets her words control his emotions. He's still reacting to her. He hasn't completely left yet.A good therapist can help your partner regulate his emotions, combat shame, create emotional distance from his ex and erect proper boundaries. He needs your support in moving forwards, not going backwards. I wish you the best.", "topic": "relationships"}

{"id": "counsel_00730", "question": "I'm a female freshman in high school, and this question is for my male best friend. At the start of freshman year, we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date. He has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two. I have nothing against her except for the fact that she has Tim's heart. He is convinced that they are in love, and maybe they are, but I don't really believe him. Lately, Tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when Sally leaves for college at the end of term this year. He's been asking me to help him with Sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her. But he's also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they won't have to deal with it when she leaves. He seems really torn up about it, and I want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves. He knows that I still crush on him. He doesn't rub it in my face. He's a good guy, but I want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us. How do I do that when the time comes? How do I support him and show him that I'm here without wanting to hook up? How do I make him feel better? He is convinced he's never going to be able to love anyone ever again, which I think is ridiculous.", "answer": "First off, I think it is great that you are willing and able to help out your friend with issues regarding his current relationship, despite the fact that you have feelings for him. I think that the best thing you can do is let him know that you are there for him if he wants to talk about things. You can also help by presenting options that he has and help him weigh out the pros and cons of his decision, but ultimately he has to decide what to do. Know that you won't be able to heal the pain he feels when his girlfriend leaves but you can be a friend to him by simply listening, validating his feelings, and understanding. Regarding your question about being there for him without wanting to hook up....I'm not sure if that is possible. If you care for him on more than a friendship level, then that desire will likey be there for you no matter what. Be careful that you take care of yourself and don't jeopardize your own happiness while trying to help him with his issues. Good luck to you!", "topic": "relationships"}

Since then, he has still been in contact with me every day. We spent some time together over the holidays, but then I was gone for New Years with family. I came to find out that he put himself on a dating site. When I found out, I asked him about it, and he responded with this: “My apologies if I got my signals crossed, or if I wasn’t honest with you. You have helped me tons this past year and I am glad you are in my life. I didn’t realize you were still interested in dating. Again, my apologies.” Also, is it better to say that I want him in my life or that I want him as part of my life?", "answer": "It sounds like there is a bit of confusion regarding how you two feel about each other. Do you know what type of relationship you want with him? A friendship only, casual dating, or an exclusive relationship? I would encourage you to first figure that out and then communicate to him how you are feeling. Ask him to be honest with you about how he feels and what he wants from your relationship as well. Be mentally prepared for a variety of responses from him so that there are no major surprises. By clearing the air and learning what your own and each other's desires are, you can then move forward with a plan.

This a common, unfounded fear we have. I wonder if maybe you miss the feeling of being in love and having a partner more than you miss him. The bottom line is you can't make someone love you, and you can't make someone be loving towards you, because how someone treats you (and the choices they make) has everything to do with who they are, and nothing to do with who you are.

It's also understandable that you would feel helpless and guilty, given that you see how these thoughts are effecting your relationship, though I would encourage you to go easy on yourself and remember that you aren't choosing to have these thoughts. I'm sure that if there was a switch to turn them off, you would flip it.There is no magic technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away, however, therapy may still have a lot to offer. In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to gain insight into where these thoughts are coming from and develop new ways of relating to them so that they do not leave you feeling as helpless and guilty and can be more present with your partner. Though there is no guarantee that the thoughts will go away, this may also be a result of work with a therapist.

What should I do?", "answer": "Oh Chino, I only have half the picture here so I will be cautious. There's a chicken and an egg, and I don't know which came first. One thing I see clearly is that your fiance will always have to have communications with his ex, because they have children. Can you accept that? When suspicion and insecurity come along, your job is to look at the big picture and the real picture. Is there any real evidence that he is cheating? Remember that texting his ex is not evidence alone if the communications are about the kids. Has he earned your trust? If so, then it's not fair to punish him for the betrayals of others. He's not your ex. Reassure your heart that you are his priority if the larger evidence supports that. At the same time, you can let him know what your triggers are. For example, hiding his phone doesn't send you a good message, right? See, this is the chicken and the egg...is he hiding the phone because you've been overreacting when he gets a text? So let him know you won't blow up about him getting a text if he doesn't conceal or password his phone. Transparency helps build trust. You have sensitivities, and it helps you a lot if he's aware of them and willing to try not to do things that trigger fear.

Now we've become friends, but there's this huge sexual tension between us, or at least I feel it when we're physically in the same place. Two summers ago, we saw each other casually for a while, but we never had sex then or while we were dating, which was only for two months three years ago. I'm now in my 20s, and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his 30s. Despite the age difference, I know we're a really good match. We've never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out. I tell him everything. Also, my ex-boyfriend has a girlfriend now as well. He’s been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years, besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing. That summer, I told him I didn't want anything serious and broke it off. Only a week later, he had gotten back together with his girlfriend. His girlfriend is kind of mean spirited. I'm sure she may be different around him, but I worry about him committing to her in the long run. They're supposed to move in together soon.

I don't know what it is, but it's driving me crazy. I’m so happy with my current boyfriend, and I know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling. He’s such a good person. I also know my ex-boyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things, but I can't get it out of my head. I'm trying to take a nap right now between classes, but I can't sleep because my mind is racing. I've never been so hung up on something for this long ever. I want to just talk it out with my ex-boyfriend, but I don't know if that's a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face. If he told his girlfriend, everything could go wrong because she hates me. If my current boyfriend knew, he would be crushed. On one hand, I want my ex-boyfriend to say no to having feelings for me, but I would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too. Where would I go from there?

It could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas, but that you just don't feel excited about him for some reason. That's a pretty important element to be missing.It may be that, even if you are happy with your current boyfriend, you still hold something special for your ex. If you feel the need to see what is possible there, I think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first. You can't have everything.If you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend, you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex, because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship.

When we are in relationships, trust is so integral to our satisfaction within the relationship. Often, when we feel we are required to prove ourselves, feelings of resentment can replace those feelings of wanting to be supportive. In situations like this, I often recommend being open and honest in your communication with your partner. Your fears about his response are valid, as he made an assumption which you cannot disprove because you cannot battle against a shadow fact. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can always ask him why he is so concerned you are unable to remain faithful and challenge those beliefs with the facts that disclaim them. You can also ask your partner what it is that he needs from you to help you to help him trust in your responses. In the end, these are issues that you cannot conquer for him - you can only guide him and show him the path towards trust.

You have a long list of complaints about your boyfriend! It sounds like he's maybe a bit immature and moody, and these things affect you, for sure. I get it. It's got me curious, and if I was working with you, I'd want to know a lot more about how long you've been together and what's actually working well between you two. I would also ask a lot of questions about the details of your description. What tells you he's 'sneaky'? Does he lie? How do you know he lies to you? Also, are you wanting to make things better with him, do you just want an ear to vent to, are you looking for validation, or do you hope someone will help you wake up to an unhappy situation? It helps me if I know what you want.Whenever I meet someone who has a lot of complaints about their partner or boyfriend, I encourage them first to look at the language they're using. Some of your words tell me that you think you know what he's thinking (that he wants to fight so he can leave, that he thinks he's perfect). It's always tricky when we assume what someone's thinking, and in an argument or dialogue, these kinds of statements tend to lead to defensiveness and an escalated argument. I'd encourage you to focus on his actual behaviours and how they affect you, rather than the motives or beliefs you think are behind the behaviours (because you really can't know what he's thinking unless he tells you). As a general rule, the \"When you do X, I feel Y\" sentence goes far in helping others understand what we feel.So, it's fair to say \"when you lie to me, I can't trust you\", or \"when you end our date early to hang with your friends I feel like I'm not important to you\", or \"your mood swings are difficult for me\", or \"I don't seem to get apologies from you\". Try to focus on his actual behaviour when you talk to him about this stuff. A relationship counsellor can help you each understand the other better beyond the surface behaviours if you want to improve the relationship.That said, I have to ask...if you haven't been with Mr. Not So Great for very long, is it maybe time to rethink the relationship? Unless there is a balance of really loving and positive behaviours that you're leaving out, you don't seem happy. A good therapist can help you understand why you are stuck in an unhappy relationship, if that is what's happening.

I'm very hurt and confused.", "answer": "Congrats on having your daughter!Have you told your partner about your feelings of \"hurt and confused\"?This is one possible way of opening a conversation about the different ways you each feel about one another and whether either of you would like changing or continuing to live together, in light of the change in emotional connection.The first step of having a dialogue about a relationship is being clear on what you are feeling, what you are willing to contribute to the relationship and what you would like having in return from your partner.Ask your partner if she is willing to have a conversation on these topics. Then, allow some time so each of you is clear about their own expectations and what is possible to offer the other.This is a fairly complex process and very often is difficult to keep on track without outside help to keep the discussion focused.It is normal for emotions to override our logic when discussing matters we care about deeply.If the conversations don't go very far, or if your partner has no interest in talking, stick with your own interest to more fully understand matters.Interview some therapists to find one whom you feel helps you clarify and find direction for yourself about this situation.", "topic": "relationships"}

In fact, it is often a self fulling prophesy because his accusatory manner becomes unbearably frustrating. What advice might you offer?", "answer": "With any type of criticism, it is usually best to introduce the topic at a neutral time, ie: when both of you are relaxed, with no current stressors involved, having fun, etc. Begin with a non-judgmental reflective comment about a recent bothersome event, as if it were just then crossing your mind (therefore not something you've been consumed with ruminating over - eases the impulse for him to dive straight into defense mode).Then share how you felt at the time of the event. Just say when.... I felt kind of hurt / shocked (or whatever the feeling was). PERIOD. THATS ALL YOU SHOULD SAY. Wait for him to respond to your matter-of-fact statement.No matter what his response is, stick to your same message - don't get overwhelmed by trying to rephrase or explain your view as that will likely set you up for continued arguing. You can even add, \"I agree I could have misunderstood it (event)....

It's strange I want to be loved but I'd hate to be because I always lose.", "answer": "As a relationship therapist I work with a lot of people who feel similar feelings to some degree or another and almost always find that the origin of these feelings point back towards childhood. How did you caregivers express (or not express) love towards you? How did they express (or not express) love towards one another. These early messages become your template for how you have learned to see yourself and what you expect from others. In his book Wired for Love, Stan Tatkin, PsyD writes “We learn to love ourselves precisely because we have experienced being loved by someone. We learn to take care of ourselves because somebody has taken care of us. Our self worth and self-esteem also develop because of other people.” This could be very fruitful to explore in individual therapy with a relationship therapist who really gets it, you may have to interview a few to find the right fit; that's OK. Maybe you'd even want to read that book I linked above. :) Noticing this pattern is HUGE, it's where transformation begins.

I need some help to save our family.", "answer": "Hello, I do not live in the California area. However, perhaps I could make some suggestions as to where you might look for free counseling. First, I must mention that most insurances now cover for many different types of issues, including family issues. If your girlfriend lives with you, most insurances now cover \"live-in partners,\" as well. If you have insurance, contact your policy provider and ask whether or not couples counseling is included.Aside from insurance, the next place that comes to mind is a religious affiliation. Do you belong to a church or other religious organization? Many of the pastors or leaders in these disciplines have significant training in counseling, as well as assisting with marriage and couples counseling. These services are ordinarily offered free of charge to members.Another option might be to explore support groups within the area. There may be a group in the form of a couples support group that brings couples together to explore their relationships in the safety of the group. If you find there are no such groups in your area, there are anonymous, support groups online. Here is one such site: http://relationship.supportgroups.com/", "topic": "relationships"}

That's huge. Really. I find that when people lie, it's most often as a defense mechanism. Which is likely a flag that something doesn't feel safe. What exactly doesn't feel safe could be lots of different things but the key to notice is that it's that feeling of insecurity that is very likely triggering you.

They adore pleasing humans and often LOVE to work on learning what you want and expect from them. Your girlfriend on the other hand, likely has her own desires and needs that she attend to before tuning into yours. You are good with dogs, that tells me that you've spent some time observing their behavior. The first step in working through this issue would be similar, start to tune into and observe your girlfriend more often... Observation is a skill when it comes to relationship building. The skills you have mastered in relating with your dogs can carry over, you will just have to relearn what behaviors you are watching.

I recommend that you sit and have a discussion with him now that you are calm about why you were upset and how you would like to handle such incidents in the future. If you find yourself becoming upset again, I encourage you to take a 20 minute break and then come back to the conversation once you are no longer heated.

I know the mistakes that I've made in my life. I'm having a really hard time getting back on my feet. Can you help me please?", "answer": "I want to applaud you for taking this first step towards realizing that this is an issue and wanting to do something about it. You are already on the road to a happier life with this realization. A lot of women do not recognize that it may be something about them that continues to attract a man like this and will only blame it on the men for treating them that way. Until you realize there is a problem you won’t start looking for a solution.Don’t misunderstand me! The abuse is not your fault! You are seeing a pattern, though, so this does need to be addressed. First, go and buy the book “Boundaries: Where You End and I Begin” by Anne Katherine. Read it. This book describes many situations that are similar to yours, describes how a person came to be that way, and how to stop it. You will have to learn to set good boundaries in your life and to maintain them.Be single for a while. Stay single until you feel like a whole, healthy, happy person on your own. Often we get in a relationship because of a need. If you feel like you need a person in your life to make you a whole person then you are in a relationship for the wrong reasons. The first step is to work on whatever it is in you that makes you feel like you need another person in your life. Identify those needs and then learn to fulfill them on your own.I was doing a couples therapy session and the husband was being emotionally abusive to the wife. This was a recurrent theme for her, like you are saying it is for you. However, she had been doing a lot of work on her own and in private therapy, and this was a new relationship. Obviously she still had not “gotten it right” because she did once again attract a man with these tendencies. The difference this time was that she had done a lot of work on herself and had become a stronger person. When she looked at him in our session and said to him “I don’t need you. I want you. But not if you are going to continue to act like this. So you leave the house and don’t come back until you are ready to make some changes.” She stuck to that, too. He didn’t leave for two more days because he kept telling her he would do different and begging to be allowed to stay. She had drawn a boundary and stuck to it, and he left. She was fully prepared to be single again. They actually did end up working things out in the end.You can’t let someone stay and continue to treat you badly. Sure, a marriage takes work and compromise on both sides. Couples therapy can help you both learn to communicate in a healthier way with each other and can help you realize what areas in the relationship need work. You may not realize how some of the things you say to him comes across, and he may not realize how what he says does to you. A therapist can help you with this so that you both learn how your words can hurt. But you need to know your boundaries and be prepared to stick to them and not compromise your boundaries. That means following through on the threat to leave when he continues to abuse you. Someone can’t do that if they are too scared to be alone. If they feel they need the other person in their life. These patterns are developed in early childhood from what we learn from our parents. When someone has grown up in a dysfunctional family, it is all they know. Even when you can say that you realize it is a problem, you still don’t know how to stop it because you never learned any other way of interacting with people. Something that took a lifetime to learn will take time and work to overcome. Be patient with yourself and find a good therapist. You can’t change your partner. Work on you, and when you begin to heal and feel healthy, the right people will come into your life and stay. The more you focus on trying to change the wrong ones to be what you want the more frustrated you will become.", "topic": "relationships"}
{"id": "counsel_00766", "question": "I have been with a guy for 4 years, he's a great guy and we also have a son together. The problem is that I'm in love with a guy that I've been talking to for about 2 years but I've never met him in person. Honestly I'm bored with the relationship I have with the first guy and he makes want to go after the second guy, I don't know how to tell him that. What should I do?", "answer": "Hi there. Wow, this sounds like a sticky situation; however, I’m here to help guide you through this decision. First and foremost, you must ask yourself, if you ever loved your sons’ father or was it a situation to where you two got pregnant and stayed together for the child. It’s very common to stay with your partner when a child is involved regardless, if love is involved or not because “it’s the right thing to do.” Right? Well, not entirely. Although, staying with your partner because you have a child together may seem right, in fact, it hurts the child in the long run. If you are not love with your partner, you will show distance, unhappiness, sadness, possibility of frequent arguments and cheating. When a child grows up in the home and witnesses these types of emotions & behaviors it is unhealthy as he/she will expect their own relationships to be such. As a responsible adult, you are supposed to be there to shape and model the future for your child. Just remember, what you do, your child will model. Secondly, do not sell yourself short from love. Everyone deserves to be happy and to have someone to share their love and intimacy with. However, being in love with someone you have never seen before can be very risky. Honestly, that sounds like lust and the longing of love. Humans have needs and when people are unhappy in their current relationship, they often seek out what they need. If you decide to pursue the second relationship, I would suggest setting up an outing with a friend or two in order to get to know this person as there are a lot of scammers these days. Finally, I am not convinced that this has anything to do with choosing between two guys. This seems as if you are making a decision to end the relationship with your child’s father or not. You should ask yourself, if you were in love with your child’s father first off. If you were, you would have never sought after love. I hope this was helpful for you and I hope I was able to shed a different light on your situation. Take care of yourself!", "topic": "relationships"}

Your boyfriend seems to be a very selfish and immature man who reconnects with you when it's convenient for him. Obviously, he has his own issues, but I want to address yours. I agree you need to talk to someone. The fact that you’ve put up with his repeated cheating and then letting him blame you for it (by saying you're not affectionate enough, etc.), tells me you probably have low self-esteem and have likely told yourself over the years that you don't deserve any better. You do! You may truly love this guy, but based on his behaviors, he does not love you, not in the way you deserve. And although you may want to believe he can change, he has proved over and over again that he's not willing to, so you need to do what is best for you and your children. What would you tell your daughters if someone was treating them this way? Would you want your sons to treat women this way? That's what you're teaching your children when they see this.Like I said, I agree that you should talk to someone. You can ask your boyfriend to go too, but my guess is he won't. Even if he does, you should still see someone individually to work on YOU. I understand it's not easy to just kick him out, especially since you have children together, but a counselor can help you talk through all the details while helping you raise your self-esteem and self-worth.", "topic": "relationships"}

It all started when she went to Missouri to visit her family. The first week she was there she was fine then once she went to this one sister’s house everything changed. That's when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore. I thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again. Then she told me to come to her in Missouri. So that's what I did. I quit my job I dropped everything, said goodbye to my family in Florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her. Once I got there everything was fine again. She apologized for everything and said she didn't mean any of it then we were good for about a week. Then she went back to saying she didn’t love me anymore and had no feelings for me. The only thing that really gets me and makes me not want to accept this is that now she is pregnant. This wasn’t an accident. We were trying to get pregnant, so all this is hard to accept. I love her so much. I have never been bad to her. I've treated her the best I can. I wanted her to be my wife. I was going to propose to her when she got back. Now I'm losing my family and my mind.

Some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant, and all this does is bring up more problems.You say you never treated her badly, and I believe you. People in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on. In fact, giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a “self” outside of this relationship can be unhealthy. It takes two whole, healthy, happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole, healthy, happy couple in a relationship. Expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to work.There are two books that I recommend you buy and read. One is Codependent No More. The other is Can My Relationship Be Saved?Sometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone, it makes you both miserable. You cannot change her and cannot change her mind. Sometimes the best thing is to let go. If it is meant to be, you will end up back together again. It seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is the one that keeps doing the leaving. I suggest backing off and letting her go. Maybe she needs time to clear her head and make up her mind. If it is meant to be, she will come back.

We get a lot of pressure from others and even ourselves to define who we are and what we want at a pretty early age. The truth is, our sexuality can change and grow in directions we never imagined. I may be wrong, but I am getting the impression that you may not want to be gay. That this is something you didn't like others suggesting and now you are uncomfortable with the idea that it may be true. This would certainly be understandable. Your sexuality is YOURS and yours alone. It can be quite frustrating and hurful when others try to define who you are. And it can be equally frustrating when you are trying to figure it out for yourself. The truth is that there are many different possibilities when it comes to sexual orientation. It may help to think about what qualities you find attractive. What kind of person can you see yourself being attracted to? Someone smart? Funny? Loves dogs? If you look for these qualities in a person they may lead you to being attracted to someone of the same sex, but maybe not. At least you would be choosing someone based on values and qualities that you love and admire. Another idea is to chat with a counselor, if you are interested. Preferrably one who has done some training in affirmative therapy. Be well and be you..Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC", "topic": "lgbtq"}

Women are attractive, but not like before. I can also find men attractive now. I'm too ashamed to tell anyone.", "answer": "Hello, and thank you for reaching out to ask for help. Surely this is a very confusing time for you! If you have never had these feelings and desires it could certainty shake everything you thought you knew about yourself. My guess is that you becoming sick around the time that this started is likely a coincidence, but I understand how you would make the connection. I have a feeling that a few things may be going on here. It is really hard to say since I don’t know you, how old you are, etc. But, I will share you with you some thoughts. Some people, when they have undesirable thoughts that really surprise them, have a really tough time getting rid of them. Our reaction to the thought can be very strong and our tendency to try to block it out, stuff it, avoid it, etc. is not always successful. In fact, it’s usually not. It’s like telling you not to think of pink elephants. I would be willing to bet that you thought of a pink elephant just now. So, rather than fighting thoughts that you find confusing, sometimes it is helpful to allow yourself to explore the thought with curiosity and without judgement. Where is this thought coming from? What are my feelings about it? Asking yourself these questions may help you come to a resolution about what is going on. One possibility is that you have developed an anxiety about your thoughts and now you are in the process of obsessing about them, but another possibility is that you are legitimately exploring your sexuality and gender. I get the feeling from your question that you do not want to believe that it is second possibility. And that is okay. You can try some of my suggestions, but you can also see a counselor who may be able to help you work through your confusion. I would suggest someone who has experience working with sexuality issues. You can usually find out what a counselor works with on their website. What is important is that you find someone who is non-judgmental about what you are experiencing. I wish you well. Robin J.

{"id": "counsel_00784", "question": "Often times I find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes I even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I can't get it out. How can I stop these thoughts?", "answer": "Scary thoughts can feel overwhelming at times as well as feeling quite real. I want to acknowledge how scary they can feel, but there is hope and new skills you can learn to work with these types of thoughts. The first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them. I also realize that might seem really hard to do, but here's a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work. Thoughts arise in the mind all the time, our brain is a thought machine. Many thoughts drift by like clouds and we don't pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way, i.e., scary, angry, happy, sad, and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particulate thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety. So, how do we work or stop those scary thought streams? One new skill to implement comes from the work of Rick Hansen, he wrote the book Buddha's Brain,\" he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts. Hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way, the brain is like Velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts. There are reasons that our brain works this way, but I don't have time to go into all of that in this response. So, it's just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking, actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories, this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time. If a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments, and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought.", "topic": "behavioral-change"}

Personality disorders are difficult to treat, However, there are some approaches that might yield better outcomes than others.I have never heard of ignoring them as a way to deal with a narcissist. Researcher and psychologist Bessel Van der Kolk recommended that using a person-centered approach in which unconditional positive regard is upheld can be helpful in the treatment of NPD as far therapeutic approaches are concerned. Approaches in which the individuals feels validated by their therapist usually works best with this population,if they agreed to participate in therapy.

It's great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive. At the root of it is fear. Fear of losing someone, fear of being alone, fear of not being good enough. All those fears can lead to low self-esteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you don't lose them. The thing is, controlling other people only pushes them away. Vicious circle, right? What I would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking. You can start with this assignment. Write down all the things you think about yourself, positive and not-so-positive. Then rewrite those not-so-positive things so they are positive. For example, thinking something like, \"I'm too pushy\", can be rewritten as, \"I'm assertive and I go after what I want.\" It can be hard to do since we tend to get \"stuck\" in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves. If you have someone you trust, you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourself.Finding a good cognitive therapist can help you further, but if that's not an option for you right now, there are lots of self-help books and websites that are out there.

Why can't I force myself to change?", "answer": "Hello, and thank you for your question. Changing unwanted behavior is one of the hardest things a person can do. I agree with Sherry that being patient with yourself is important. Here are a few things I would suggest:1. Get clear on the behaviors you really want to change, and make sure they are behaviors that CAN be changed. Sometimes we will set a goal like, \"I want to be more confident\" but that is hard to measure and prove to yourself that you accomplished it. Saying you are going to accept a date or go on a job interview is something you can actually do, and something that you may consider to be demonstrating confidence. Whatever your change of behavior is, make sure it is something you can actually change. 2. If you are going to give up a behavior, decide what you are going to do in place of it. So, if you are going to stop showing up late for work, then you are deciding to be on time for work and demonstrating your value of being punctual. 3. If you are going to make changes, really nail down WHY you want to make them. What is it about making these changes that is important to you as a person? For example, if you have the goal of weight loss, the reason this is important to you as a person may be because you value self-care. Knowing WHY you want to make changes is both your motivation and your compass for getting there. 4. Once you know WHY you want to make these changes, I strongly suggest setting small goals. If you set too high of goals you may not accomplish them and just feel worse. So, make the goal small, realistic, and guided by the the things you want to be as a person. 5. As Sherry mentioned, finding a counselor is sometimes a good idea if you really feel stuck. Any counselor who does work with goal-setting and motivation can probably help.

Do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is? If you have not actually kicked him, then I would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt, since you did not hurt him.

Bipolar disorder is generally characterized by extreme changes in mood, ranging from mania (highs) to depression (lows). There are different types; however, so here is a website that gives you a list of symptoms for mania and depression in bipolar disorder: http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/bipolar-disorder-manic-depression?page=2After reviewing these symptoms, if you believe you may have bipolar disorder, then you may want to see your primary care provider or a counselor. Bipolar disorder is treatable, but for many people it requires the right medication and sometimes counseling to help people make behavior changes that are important for bipolar management. For example, some people may not get regular sleep, but proper rest is important for bipolar management. A counselor may talk to you about this and other lifestyle changes that you may need to make. The good news is that many people live happy, healthy, and productive lives with bipolar disorder. So, if it turns out that you do have bipolar disorder, it doesn't mean that things can't get better. There is currently no \"cure\" for bipolar disorder, but with proper medication and lifestyle management, people can do quite well.Hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J.

{"id": "counsel_00809", "question": "I have an ex-boyfriend who just lies about everything. He is super lazy. He lies to everyone that he has a good job, builds trust, and then start borrowing money—and large amounts too. It has come to the point where he has gone through several group of friends. He is leaving a trail behind full of friends in debt because he would put on a sob story, borrow money, then disappear. He refuses to work, so he sits at home playing games all day and either lies to his mom for money or lies to his friends. I used to think his lying was due to his drug habit, but now I'm hearing from other ex-friends of his that this started even before the drugs got into his life. He would borrow anywhere from $5,000 to $50,000 from everyone and it would all disappear. He's in debt with bills. He doesn't gamble, but he spends his money on random stuff. Although he has this habit of lying compulsively and spending money, he seems to be a good person. He'll always give a homeless person all his change no matter what. My brother has epilepsy and is really antisocial—my ex-boyfriend makes an actual effort to socialize with my brother. He takes him out to the movies and plays video games with him. He drives me to school and work every day and picks me up—just basically the small things that add up to the fact that he's not totally a horrible human being. Is he just simple a pathological liar or is there something that could possibly be deep down in there?", "answer": "It sounds like you have some ambivalent feelings towards your ex-boyfriend that are difficult to sort out.

One question that I would have for you is, are you satisfied with your relationship with him as it currently stands? Are you happy with the boundaries between the two of you, or would you like them to be different? Negotiating through conflict and establishing different boundaries are definitely things you could work on with the help of a therapist. Another question I would have for you is, what would it mean for you to find out what motivates his behavior? Discovering the roots of such behavior is something that he would have to work on in his own therapy and not something that you and a therapist could discover without him.", "topic": "behavioral-change"}

Recently this year (my first year of high school), I started getting emotional for no reason.", "answer": "Hello Vancouver, It's really common for people to become very upset over small things sometimes. The small thing is a \"trigger\", and the emotions aren't so much about that event that's happening in the present; they are more connected to old events that evoked the same feeling. You've likely had too much of that feeling in your life and you've developed a sensitivity to it. Look at the small events that are triggers for you and ask yourself what same or similar emotion they evoke. If there's anger there, look underneath that. Is it powerlessness, worthlessness, hurt, shame...? Then ask yourself when in your life you've experienced TOO much of that feeling. As a child, maybe, but not necessarily. That's the first step, and combined with empathy, compassion and self-esteem, you're starting to build what I call an emotional air conditioner.

I'm not sure why I do it, but I want to stop. How can I find the willpower?", "answer": "Congratulations on taking the first step on the road towards recovery by acknowledging the problem and asking for help! The American Society of Addiction Medicine defines addiction as \"a treatable, chronic medical disease involving complex interactions among brain circuits, genetics, the environment, and an individual's life experiences. People with addiction use substances or engage in behaviors that become compulsive and often continue despite harmful consequences.\" Notice that nothing in the definition speaks about willpower or motivation. That's because addiction is a disease - just like diabetes or high blood pressure. Imagine I gave a huge piece of chocolate cake to a diabetic. After he eats the cake, I say to him \"Use your willpower to lower your glucose to 100.\" Do you think he would be successful? All addictions are behaviors. Behavior can be understood in terms of function and reinforcement. All behavior is either an attempt to get something or an attempt to get away from something. If you apply this logic to addictive behaviors, the use of mood-altering substances is an attempt to create a particular feeling or emotion, or an attempt to numb one. When a behavior is reinforced, we are more likely to engage in the same behavior again in the future. Let's assume that I'm feeling very anxious. I drink some alcohol and notice that my anxiety decreases. My brain takes note of this and the next time I'm feeling anxious I am more likely to reach for a bottle. Now, imagine this happening hundreds, if not thousands, of times. Addiction recovery is about identifying and treating the underlying reasons for the use. A qualified addiction therapist will assist you in developing a relapse prevention plan that addresses these underlying issues and helps you to identify triggers for your use. Additionally, you will learn how to avoid triggers and gain healthy coping skills to use instead of relying on alcohol. I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors. Recovery can be difficult and requires a willingness to change just about everything in your life. But the rewards are tremendous!", "topic": "addiction"}

Since the answer to this question will depend a lot on the applicable state laws, I would suggest talking with a local attorney. That being said, I see two competing issues here.

The social worker’s voicemail message says that he returns calls in 24 hours, but he hasn't called me back. I called him on the weekend and made it clear that I want him to call me back. Can he just ignore me?", "answer": "Mental health providers should promptly return calls from current clients as well as from potential clients. This is even true if the social worker (or counselor) is unable to make an appointment with the caller. In that case the social worker should call you back to let you know that he is unable to schedule an appointment with you.In addition, mental health providers have an obligation to follow through with their own communication standards. For example, if the social worker in this case has an outgoing voicemail message that promises returned calls within 24 hours, he has an obligation to follow through on that promise.All that being said, it is also worth remembering that mental health professionals are just people too. It is possible that he had an unforeseen emergency that kept him from from returning your call promptly.In the end, I agree with Sherry's advice.

When a client has met their goals, that is a good time to end counselling sessions unless the client has new goals or simply wants to check-in periodically to make sure that they are still on track (sometimes referred to as relapse prevention). When a client is not progressing, and feedback has been taken and attempts have been made to make the therapy more helpful for the client but to no avail, than it is considered unethical to continue to work with the client.

I don't know what to do.", "answer": "I'm sorry to hear that this has happened. Counselors are legally and ethically required to make sure that they always put the wellbeing of their clients above their own interests. In addition, counselor ethical rules, and the laws in just about every state, make it illegal for counselors to take advantage of a client financially. A counselor borrowing money from a client (even if the counselor pays it back) would usually be considered to be taking advantage of the client.There are a few options you have at this point if you can't (or don't want) to continue to try to contact him directly. You can file a complaint with your states' regulatory board and let them know what has happened. An investigator will then look into the situation for you.

I have never had sex before, nor have I had a boyfriend. I feel lonely and empty. I feel like my body is not okay, and I am missing something. I talk to so many boys in school, and I always fantasize about half of them. I want this feeling to stop because it is interfering with my time to study since most of the time, I am busy thinking about sex.", "answer": "Hi Montreal, I'm glad you wrote. What you're experiencing is normal. We're sexual beings. We have a built-in desire to connect sexually with others, because it feels good, to keep procreation going, and mostly to \"connect\" with other people, because connecting with others makes us feel fulfilled and valuable. Sexual desire is a healthy part of you. Maybe your body is telling you it wants to dive into that water and taste it instead of just staring at it? It sounds like you're beginning to explore yourself sexually, and that's okay.At your young age, you also have another innate burning desire, and that is to know yourself. I see both of these desires burning and competing in you. It's a bit of a crazy time...you want to connect with others but you're not sure who you are or what you want from them. You want to know yourself but you can't learn about yourself in a vacuum. It's okay to trust your instincts. It's okay to connect sexually with others, as long as you're preventing disease and pregnancy and you know how to protect your boundaries. But even as I write this, I think maybe I'm being controlling and overprotective of you; it's your body and you're in charge of what happens to it! (But I do want you to be safe...whatever that means to you). Maybe talk to someone you trust. With each encounter you have with other people (sexual or not), you will learn more about yourself and what you want, both sexually and just in relationship or friendship. You will develop a sense of who you are.Have you tried to get to know yourself sexually? This is a super place to start, and knowing how your own body works can give you confidence when you eventually connect with others. When you explore your own body, what feels good? What brings you to orgasm? I wish you well as you explore both who you are and how it feels to connect with others safely. :)", "topic": "human-sexuality"}

Well, yes. And, I consider your question as a mark of your sensitive awareness toward other people. Being able to recognize social dynamics, is a strength that you have.Psychopaths know how to be charming and to twist words so that others believe that their own interest is the same as the psychopath's.I agree with you about not being able to change people's minds who are attached to this person's interactions.The only way you can introduce a change in the relationship system of a psychopath is that if you are aware of illegal or law breaking activity, and you have evidence of this, that you contact relevant authorities.No one is allowed to break laws, including psychopaths.", "topic": "social-relationships"}

I’m here to tell you that living in the now or being mindful is a skill anyone can learn. Unfortunately, the only way to do it is to do it. What a paradox! But there are plenty of other skills that we are not born with: walking on stilts, riding a bike, swimming, and driving a car are good examples. You can’t learn them by reading about them.Having said that, I can recommend two books on the subject: Eckhart Tolle’s The Power of Now and David Richo’s When the Past is Present. Richo asks that we don’t beat ourselves up about dwelling on past events. This is nature’s way of reminding us that we have unfinished business. But while we are attended to the wounds and confusion that litter our earlier lives, we can prepare to inhabit the expanded present that awaits us.He offers three helpful steps to making any important life change:Step One: Hold in awareness the behavior, belief, attitude, or characteristic you want to change in yourself and how you want to be different. Awareness is the opposite of distraction and stuffing.Step Two: Live as if you have already made the change. (This is hard and takes courage, but you can do it. Ride that bike—even if for a foot or two.)Step Three: Be persistent.

Communication is key to any relationship. I would recommend speaking with your friends face-to-face to address why they feel your behavior is concerning. In-person contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts, emails or any written response can be misconstrued. Be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded. If after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling, maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly. Especially if this friendship is valuable to you. However, make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them. On the other hand, if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded, it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship. Not all friendships are healthy ones. And it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder it.I hope you are able to get this matter sorted.

But not in the mornings. What can I do?", "answer": "It seems like you are being extra hard on yourself here! The behavior he exhibits is pretty normal for a three year-old. Sounds like he may feel more emotionally dysregulated upon waking and wants one of his love sources to help him stabilize that. It's probably more instinctual and not personal to you.Give yourself some credit for how things are the rest of the day---that's information that you've done well. You even describe that he \"loves\" you! That's huge!Either way, I'm sure it's jarring to go through that in the mornings. Is there a routine you use to help him make that transition? I don't know what his parents' rules are, but there could be some ways to incorporate some predictable structure. Maybe that means his favorite toy/stuffed animal paired with his favorite cartoon. You seem very caring, so it's probably likely you are already offering some compassionate response to his upset. It may help to have him take a couple deep breaths with you if he's able to help self-regulate. He may not be responsive to that and that's OK. Either way, it sounds like this is only happening upon waking.Another thought--do his parents know this is happening?

When I am determining what type of personality a client has, I take my time and really absorb their lens/ point of view to themselves and others. Determining a personality type takes some time getting to know the person, and building rapport. After taking time to get to know them, and learning about their view they have of themselves and others, it is important to pick-up on more specific personality traits, which comprehensively contribute to a personality type. Clinicians, including myself, often witness certain traits that are enduring and consistent, which indicate a type of personality. For example, if a therapist is noticing that a client is exhibiting traits of organization, needing to be on time, planning, and perfectionism, these traits contribute to the \"type A personality\". In addition to utilizing clinical judgment, clinicians often use personality assessments and follow the guidelines of the DSM-5/ ICD-10.", "topic": "diagnosis"}

You might want to try imagining that you have a volume dial on your empathy (just like the volume dial or button on the tv) that you can gently turn down to the point where you still feel what's going on but it's not so \"loud\". You can also try imagining pulling your own energy back as if you were drawing your energy back home to the center of your own body and being, letting go of the other people or characters that pulled your energy out so far.

It can sometimes take a number of sessions to get a good sense of whether you and your therapist are the \"right fit.\" The first couple of sessions are generally spent on gathering information, formulating a plan of treatment, and building the client/therapist relationship. The client/therapist relationship will be very different from other relationships you have experienced. You will know you have found the right therapist when you notice there is a good rapport between the two of you. You will get a sense that the therapist \"gets you\" and understands the issues being presented. If you feel that you can trust your therapist and feel comfortable opening up and providing feedback during your sessions then you know it is a good fit. In terms of \"how to train your therapist how to give you what you need from treatment\" the therapeutic relationship is collaborative so the two of you will be working together as a team.

I tried to address it with him today, but my voice cracked and I got emotional. I'm terrified this makes me look unprofessional and that I'll be let go.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. What you're describing sounds incredibly difficult and painful. First, I want to validate what you're feeling: the stress of a critical manager, the fear of job loss, and the frustration of becoming emotional during a conversation you hoped to handle calmly are all completely understandable reactions. Many people in their first professional roles have experienced similar moments of overwhelm—you are not alone in this.\n\nIt’s important to recognize that becoming emotional does not make you unprofessional. It makes you human. Showing emotion in a high-stress situation is a natural response, not a character flaw. The fact that you gathered the courage to address the issue directly with your manager speaks to your professionalism and commitment.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, let's consider some next steps. First, prioritize your well-being. The breakdown in the stairwell is a signal that your stress levels are unsustainable. Please be kind to yourself this evening. In the coming days, you might consider requesting a follow-up meeting with your manager. You could frame it by saying, \"I'd like to continue our conversation from yesterday. I value my role here and want to ensure I'm meeting expectations.\" This reframes the interaction around your performance and goals, rather than the emotional moment.\n\nIf the criticism feels excessive or personally targeted, please document specific instances. This is for your own clarity. Also, explore if your company has an HR department or an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) that offers confidential counseling—this is exactly the type of situation they can help you navigate.\n\nYour feelings of fear are real, but remember that one emotional moment is rarely grounds for termination, especially when you are proactively seeking solutions. Your well-being is paramount. If these feelings of anxiety persist or intensify, I strongly encourage you to seek support from a mental health professional who can provide ongoing guidance tailored to you.

It is completely understandable to feel hurt, embarrassed, and anxious after being publicly berated at work. Anyone in that situation would need a moment to collect themselves, and having an emotional reaction when you tried to address it later is a normal human response to feeling overwhelmed and disrespected. Please know that your feelings are valid.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge the courage it took for you to try to explain how you felt to your supervisor. That is not an easy thing to do. Your worry about being perceived as unable to handle the job is a common reaction, but let's separate the event from your capability. A harsh, public reprimand is more a reflection of poor management and an unprofessional environment than a reflection of your competence or resilience.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, I encourage you to consider a few steps. If you feel safe to do so, you might request a private, calm follow-up conversation. You could say something like, \"I'd like to discuss what happened the other day to ensure I understand your expectations moving forward.\" This frames it professionally.

{"id": "counsel_00864_aug_0", "question": "My partner constantly interprets my friendly interactions with colleagues as flirting, like when I compliment a coworker's idea in a meeting. It leads to accusations of infidelity almost daily, and they never acknowledge if they've overreacted. How can I make them see my intentions are purely professional?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. I can hear how frustrating and hurtful this situation is for you. It sounds incredibly draining to have your professional conduct constantly questioned and to face daily accusations, especially when you know your intentions are genuine. Feeling misunderstood by your partner, particularly around something as fundamental as trust, is a very painful experience.\n\nWhat you're describing goes beyond a simple disagreement; it points to a significant breach of trust and potentially deep-seated insecurities or anxieties within your partner. While it's understandable to want to \"make them see\" your perspective, this dynamic often becomes a cycle where explanations feel like defenses, and accusations continue. This is not something you can fix alone, as it resides within the relationship's dynamic and your partner's internal world.\n\nMy primary recommendation would be to seek couples counseling with a licensed therapist. A neutral professional can create a safe space for both of you to express your feelings. In therapy, your partner can explore the roots of their insecurity in a supportive environment, and you can both learn healthier communication skills. This pattern, if left unaddressed, can lead to increased control, isolation, and emotional harm.\n\nFor your own well-being in the meantime, I encourage you to maintain your professional boundaries and friendships. You have a right to a respectful work life. Please also gently reflect on whether these accusations are part of a larger pattern of controlling behavior. If you ever feel unsafe—emotionally or physically—prioritizing your safety and reaching out to a trusted support network or a domestic violence hotline is crucial.\n\nYou deserve a relationship built on mutual trust and respect.

He's convinced I'm being unfaithful and never apologizes for the false accusations. What can I do to help him trust me and understand the nature of my job?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. I can hear how hurtful, frustrating, and exhausting this situation must be for you. It's understandable to feel distressed when your professional commitments are misinterpreted and met with accusations, especially from your partner. You deserve to feel trusted and supported in your marriage and in your career.\n\nWhat you're describing goes beyond typical workplace jealousy and enters the realm of damaging patterns of mistrust and control. His persistent accusations, lack of apology, and the reading of malice into your normal work actions are serious concerns. First and foremost, please know that his accusations are a reflection of his own insecurities or issues, not a reflection of your integrity or behavior. You cannot single-handedly \"prove\" your trustworthiness to someone who is unwilling to trust; that often deepens a cycle of needing to constantly prove yourself.\n\nMy primary recommendation, given the entrenched nature of this pattern, is to seek professional support. I strongly encourage you to propose couples counseling. A neutral therapist can facilitate a safer conversation where you can explain the demands of your job without it escalating into an accusation, and he can explore the roots of his insecurity. If he refuses to attend, I would suggest individual counseling for yourself. A therapist can help you establish healthy boundaries, communicate effectively under pressure, and navigate this dynamic for your own well-being.\n\nIn the immediate term, you might try a calm, scheduled conversation outside of any incident. Use \"I feel\" statements: \"I feel hurt and undermined when my professional integrity is questioned. I am committed to our marriage, and I need us to find a way to rebuild trust.\" However, please be mindful of your safety. If these accusations ever escalate into verbal intimidation, threats, or attempts to isolate you from your work, these are red flags. Your safety and autonomy are paramount.\n\nThis is a difficult position to be in, but you are not alone.

{"id": "counsel_00865_aug_0", "question": "I'm a project manager at a startup, and the constant pressure to meet unrealistic deadlines for low pay is making me feel burnt out and undervalued. How can I cope with this daily stress?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing what you're going through. It takes courage to acknowledge feelings of burnout, especially in a high-pressure environment like a startup. What you're describing—feeling constantly stretched thin, undervalued, and under-compensated—is incredibly draining, both emotionally and physically. Your feelings of stress and frustration are completely valid and a common human response to the situation you've outlined.\n\nFirst, let's focus on some immediate coping strategies for the daily stress. I encourage you to build small, non-negotiable buffers into your day. This could be a five-minute mindfulness or breathing exercise before a meeting, a proper lunch break away from your desk, or a firm end-time to your workday to create separation. As a project manager, you might also practice \"stress inoculation\" by anticipating high-pressure moments and mentally rehearsing calm, assertive communication. Physically, prioritizing basic sleep, nutrition, and even short walks can significantly regulate your nervous system.\n\nHowever, while coping mechanisms are essential, they don't address the root causes you've identified: unrealistic deadlines and low pay. This is where professional boundaries become crucial. I encourage you to prepare for a factual, solution-oriented conversation with leadership. Document specific examples of unrealistic deadlines and their impacts (e.g., on quality or team morale), and be prepared to propose adjusted timelines or necessary resources. Frame it from a perspective of sustainability and project success. If this feels too risky or if such conversations have failed before, it may be a sign to professionally evaluate your options elsewhere.\n\nBurnout is a signal that your current situation is unsustainable. If these feelings persist or deepen, especially if you notice changes in sleep, appetite, or mood that concern you, I strongly recommend connecting with a therapist. They can provide dedicated support as you navigate these challenges.

What steps can I take to handle this situation?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. What you're describing sounds incredibly challenging, and it's completely understandable to feel both exhausted and resentful. The legal profession is known for its demanding culture, but working extremely long hours without fair compensation can lead to burnout and a deep sense of injustice. Your feelings are valid, and it takes courage to acknowledge them and seek a path forward.\n\nFirst, let's prioritize your well-being. Chronic exhaustion isn't just an inconvenience; it can impact your mental and physical health. I encourage you to be gentle with yourself and consider integrating small, non-negotiable acts of self-care into your week, even if it's just a short walk or disconnecting for an hour. This isn't a solution to the systemic issue, but it's vital for maintaining your resilience while you navigate this.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, I recommend a two-step approach. Begin by gathering objective data. Document your hours worked, tasks completed, and the compensation (or lack thereof) for that labor over, say, the last two months. This creates clarity for you. Then, consider requesting a confidential meeting with a trusted mentor within the firm, a senior associate known for being reasonable, or your direct supervisor. Frame the conversation around your commitment to the firm and your career, and present your documented contributions. You could express your dedication while calmly stating the unsustainable nature of the current workload and its impact, and inquire about the path to fair compensation or adjusted expectations.\n\nPlease know that if the resentment and exhaustion are becoming overwhelming, seeking support from a therapist can be a powerful step. They can provide a confidential space to process these complex emotions and develop personalized coping strategies.

{"id": "counsel_00866_aug_0", "question": "I was leading a project, but my manager reassigned key parts of it to a colleague. When I asked if this was due to my performance, I was told I was being overly sensitive and seeking too much validation.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. I can hear how hurt and confused you are by this situation, and I want to start by validating that. Having key parts of a project you're leading reassigned can feel deeply undermining, and it's a very natural human reaction to seek clarity about the reasons behind it. Your question to your manager was a reasonable attempt to understand your professional standing, and being told you were \"overly sensitive\" or \"seeking too much validation\" likely compounded the hurt, making you feel dismissed. Your feelings are understandable and important.\n\nWhen we experience something like this at work, it often impacts more than just the project—it can touch on our sense of competence, value, and security. It’s crucial to separate the *event* from your *worth*. The reassignment could be due to many factors—workload redistribution, your colleague’s specific expertise, or even broader organizational shifts—that aren't a reflection of your performance.\n\nFor practical next steps, I encourage a two-pronged approach. First, for your own well-being, practice some self-compassion. Acknowledge the sting, but also remind yourself of your proven skills and past successes. Second, consider requesting a follow-up conversation with your manager, framed collaboratively. You might say, \"I've been reflecting on our last discussion and want to ensure I'm supporting the team's goals effectively. To help me grow, could you share specific feedback on my project leadership and how I can best contribute moving forward?\" This focuses on growth and clarity, rather than validation.\n\nIf these interactions continue to feel dismissive or begin to create a hostile work environment, it may be helpful to document them and consider speaking with HR. Please know that if these feelings of being undermined persist and are affecting your mood or self-esteem significantly, seeking support from a counselor for ongoing coping strategies could be very beneficial.

It sounds like that was a difficult and vulnerable moment for you. It’s completely understandable to feel worried or unsettled after a supervisor steps in, and then to have your expression of concern met with that kind of feedback. Anyone in your position might feel a mix of professional anxiety and personal sting from that comment. I want to validate your feelings—they are a normal reaction to a challenging workplace interaction.\n\nYour emphasis on your commitment shows how much you care about your work and your clients, which is a real strength. The feedback about \"excessive reassurance,\" while potentially difficult to hear, can also be viewed as a point for professional self-reflection, not a character flaw. Sometimes, patterns we develop in our communication style are rooted in a desire to do well and avoid errors, which is commendable.\n\nAs a next step, I encourage you to explore this with curiosity rather than judgment. You might ask yourself: In what situations do I feel the need to seek reassurance? Is it primarily with authority figures, or in high-stakes scenarios? A practical strategy could be to practice a brief, internal self-check before going to a supervisor. For instance, you could note: \"Here is the situation, here is what I've done, here is my proposed solution.\" This can build confidence in your own judgment. If this pattern feels deeply ingrained or is causing significant distress, exploring it with a therapist could provide valuable insights into its origins and help you develop personalized coping strategies.\n\nRemember, receiving constructive feedback is part of professional growth.

We recently crossed a line and shared a kiss, agreeing to keep it between us. Even though we said it was a one-time thing, I can't stop thinking about what it meant. We still work on projects together remotely, and our friendly, flirty banter continues. She's very physically affectionate, which makes it harder for me to move on, even though she's made it clear she just wants to be friends. How can I stop hoping for more and preserve our important work friendship?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes courage to articulate such a complex and emotionally charged situation. What you're describing is incredibly common and understandably difficult. You're navigating a mix of genuine friendship, professional collaboration, and now, unrequited romantic feelings—all while trying to maintain an important working relationship. It's no wonder you're feeling stuck and preoccupied.\n\nFirst, I want to validate that your feelings are completely normal. A significant, charged friendship that includes a moment of physical intimacy can create powerful emotional bonds and hope. The ongoing remote work and flirty banter, while perhaps meant platonically by her, understandably send mixed signals that keep those hopes alive. The core challenge here is the mismatch between your desire for more and her stated desire to remain friends.\n\nTo begin moving forward, we need to focus on what you can control: your own boundaries and interpretations. I gently encourage you to consider a few actionable steps:\n\n1.  **Reframe the \"Banter\":** For your own emotional well-being, it may be necessary to consciously interpret her physical affection and flirty comments strictly as her platonic friendship style, not as potential signals. This is a mental discipline that takes practice.\n2.  **Create Professional Distance:** During work hours and on work platforms, strive to keep interactions project-focused and cordial. It's okay to politely deflect or not engage in personal banter for a while. This isn't punitive; it's a protective measure for your heart.\n3.  **Process the Hopes:** Find a healthy outlet for these feelings outside of your interactions with her. This could be journaling, confiding in a trusted friend (unconnected to work), or speaking with a counselor. You need a space to grieve the \"what if\" without it impacting your work dynamic.\n4.  **Re-evaluate the Dynamic:** If, after setting these internal and professional boundaries, the friendship feels unsustainable or too painful, it is okay to let it naturally become a more distant, collegial relationship. Your emotional health is paramount.\n\nThis is a process, not a quick fix. Be patient and compassionate with yourself. If you find these feelings intensifying or affecting your work or overall well-being, seeking a few sessions with a therapist could provide dedicated support.

We decided it was a mistake and to keep it professional, but I'm struggling to let go of my feelings. We're now in different departments, but we chat daily and have lunch sometimes. He's a naturally warm person and gives compliments that feel personal, leaving me confused. He's dating someone else now, but I catch him looking at me in a way that reignites hope. How do I accept the situation and get over my romantic feelings without losing his friendship?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes courage to articulate such a complex and emotionally charged situation. What you're describing is incredibly challenging—navigating deep feelings for a friend and colleague, especially after a shift in the physical nature of your relationship, is a painful and confusing experience. Your desire to both preserve a meaningful friendship and find peace for yourself is completely understandable, and your feelings of hope and confusion are valid given the mixed signals you've described.\n\nThe core difficulty here lies in the conflict between your emotional reality and the agreed-upon \"professional\" boundary. To move forward, you will likely need to create more space and clarity than currently exists. While daily chats and lunches maintain a close connection, they may also be inadvertently feeding the romantic feelings you're trying to release. I would gently suggest considering a temporary, intentional pullback in contact. This isn't about punishment or ending the friendship, but about creating the emotional distance necessary for your feelings to settle. You might reduce the daily chats to a few times a week and opt for group lunches instead of one-on-one for a period.\n\nIt is also crucial to examine his behavior through the lens of his stated commitment to being \"professional\" and his current relationship. A naturally warm demeanor can feel personal, but it may not signify a change in his intentions. Protecting your heart means accepting his actions at face value: he is a friend and colleague who is dating someone else. Redirecting the energy you spend analyzing his looks and compliments into nurturing other friendships, hobbies, or personal goals can be a powerful step toward acceptance.\n\nFinally, please know that struggling to let go under these circumstances is very common. If you find these feelings persistently impacting your well-being or work, speaking with a therapist can provide a dedicated space to process this loss and develop personalized strategies.

That is a wise and self-protective step when feelings become overwhelming. It allows you to gain clarity on what you truly need and want, separate from the daily interactions at work. This situation highlights the importance of professional and personal boundaries, which can become blurred in these circumstances. It might be helpful to gently assess what level of interaction you can maintain that feels respectful to your emotional well-being and your professional responsibilities.\n\nAs a practical step, consider setting some gentle internal boundaries for yourself. This could mean limiting one-on-one social interactions outside of work for a time, or consciously redirecting conversations at work to neutral, project-related topics. Journaling can be a helpful tool to untangle your feelings and identify any patterns. It's also crucial to nurture other parts of your life—your friendships outside of work, hobbies, and self-care routines—to ensure this relationship doesn't become your sole emotional focus.\n\nGiven the complexity of navigating both a workplace and a close personal dynamic, if these feelings persist and cause significant distress, seeking a few sessions with a therapist could provide a confidential space to explore this more deeply.

I can hear how distressing this situation is for you, and it makes complete sense that you would feel upset and conflicted. You and your husband made a meaningful agreement based on shared values, and discovering a potential breach of that trust, especially in a context that involves his workplace, is understandably painful. It’s also very common to feel caught between wanting to uphold your boundaries and not wanting to create additional tension.\n\nIt’s important to first separate the two issues here: the relationship agreement with your husband, and the workplace dynamic. From a couples perspective, his defensiveness may be coming from a place of shame, feeling accused, or a fear of having disappointed you. When things are calmer, it could be helpful to have a conversation focused on \"I feel\" statements about the impact on you, rather than accusations about his actions. The goal is to reconnect on the \"why\" behind your shared value, rather than getting stuck on the single incident.\n\nRegarding the workplace, his concern about professional rapport is valid. Calling out a peer publicly could indeed create awkwardness. A potential middle path might involve him muting or leaving a group chat that shares non-work-related content, if that’s an option, or having a private, low-key word with the teammate if he feels comfortable.

Romantic or undefined tensions at work can have significant repercussions for your well-being, your colleague's, and the work environment itself.

Romantic feelings for a coworker, particularly within the same team, can create significant complications for your work environment, your emotional well-being, and potentially for others involved.

It sounds incredibly stressful to be dealing with this conflict, especially with someone you have both a personal and professional relationship with. It's completely understandable to feel hurt, confused, and that the reaction is unfair, particularly when a financial shortfall was unexpected and not intentional. Having these tensions spill over into your workplace adds a significant layer of anxiety.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge how challenging it can be when a disagreement escalates to accusations and intense messaging, particularly while he is on a business trip. His persistent messages calling you names like \"dishonest\" and \"irresponsible\" are concerning, as this shifts from a discussion about a shared expense into personal criticism. You have a right to be treated with respect, even in a disagreement.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, it's crucial to separate the logistical issue from the interpersonal one. On the logistical side, reflecting on the original agreement is a start. While the trip was his idea, you did verbally agree to contribute. A possible path forward could be to offer a sincere apology for the unexpected change in your contribution, and then propose a concrete, reasonable plan to repay the $30 when you are feasibly able to. This isn't about admitting dishonesty, but about acknowledging the impact of the changed circumstance.\n\nHowever, the core issue here is the breakdown in communication and respect.

{"id": "counsel_00871_aug_1", "question": "A coworker I've been involved with booked a hotel for us. I initially said I could cover part of the cost, but after an unexpected bill, I couldn't afford my share. He's accusing me of lying about the money and insists I owe him for the room, even though he stayed there alone. He's currently away and keeps texting, calling me a flake and suggesting I take on side gigs to pay him back. I don't think I should be responsible for his decision.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this situation with me. It sounds incredibly stressful and hurtful to be on the receiving end of these accusations and persistent contact, especially from someone you trusted. It's completely understandable to feel upset, pressured, and even betrayed. Your feelings of frustration are valid—it's a lot to manage unexpected financial strain alongside this interpersonal conflict and the pressure you're now feeling.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge the core issue here: boundaries. A personal relationship with a coworker adds layers of complexity, and his current behavior—name-calling and demanding payment for a decision he made alone—crosses professional and personal lines. His suggestion that you take on side gigs is inappropriate and adds undue pressure. You are not responsible for financing a plan that changed, and his choice to stay alone was his own.\n\nFor your immediate well-being, I encourage you to set a firm boundary. Given his aggressive communication, consider sending one clear, neutral text or email: \"I understand you are upset. My financial situation changed unexpectedly, and I cannot contribute to the hotel cost. I will not be discussing this further via text or call.\" Then, disengage. Do not justify, argue, defend, or explain (JADE). His repeated contact is designed to provoke a reaction; not participating is your power.\n\nYour safety and peace of mind are paramount. His escalating communication is a concern. Please document all calls and messages. If this continues or escalates when he returns, you may need to consider involving HR, as this now involves harassment from a colleague. This is a difficult position to be in, and you don't have to navigate it alone. If you have access to an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) or a therapist, they can provide crucial support in managing the stress and formulating a safe plan moving forward. You are not a \"flake\"; you are someone navigating a difficult circumstance with a person who is not respecting your limits.", "topic": "workplace-relationships", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00373"}
{"id": "counsel_00872_aug_0", "question": "I've been struggling with my faith lately because I feel like I can't trust anything I hear. When so many things in the world feel fabricated, how can I be sure my belief in a higher power isn't just another illusion?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. What you're describing is a deeply challenging and unsettling experience, and I want to first acknowledge the courage it takes to sit with these questions. It's completely understandable to feel this way when surrounded by so much uncertainty and misinformation. That sense of distrust can seep into the very foundations of our lives, including our spirituality, and it can feel profoundly isolating.\n\nWhat you're experiencing is not uncommon, and it can be a sign of a sincere and deepening spiritual journey, even though it feels distressing right now. Many people go through periods of deconstruction or doubt, where previously held beliefs are questioned. This isn't necessarily a loss of faith, but perhaps a transition towards a faith that is more personally authentic and resilient.\n\nAs a counselor, my role is to support you in exploring these feelings, not to provide answers about the nature of a higher power. I can offer a few pathways for exploration, however. First, I encourage you to gently shift the focus from external sources of information to your own internal experience. Instead of asking \"Is this belief true out there?\", you might ask, \"What is my personal experience of the sacred or the transcendent? What values or feelings arise when I connect with this belief?\" Practices like contemplative meditation, journaling, or spending time in nature can help you connect with a sense of meaning that feels genuine to you, separate from external narratives.\n\nIt's also okay to sit with the \"not knowing.\" You don't have to resolve this today. This process takes time and patience with yourself. If these feelings are causing significant distress, impacting your daily functioning, or leading to feelings of hopelessness, I strongly encourage you to seek ongoing support. A therapist specializing in spiritual or existential issues could provide a safe, consistent space to navigate this. You don't have to walk this path alone.", "topic": "spirituality", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00376"}
{"id": "counsel_00872_aug_1", "question": "After being let down by people I trusted, I'm starting to question everything. My spiritual beliefs used to be a comfort, but now I wonder if I've just been believing a story everyone tells. How do I find something real to hold onto?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. What you're describing is profoundly difficult—to feel let down by people you trusted is painful enough, and for that experience to ripple into your spiritual beliefs can make the world feel deeply unstable. Your feelings of questioning and disillusionment are completely valid and, in my experience, a very human response to betrayal.\n\nIt makes sense that your spiritual beliefs, once a source of comfort, now feel like they might be part of a story you were told. When human institutions or relationships fail us, it's natural to wonder if the foundations they were built on are also flawed. This period of questioning, while deeply unsettling, can also be a sacred space—a time to discern what is *truly* yours from what you may have inherited or absorbed from others.\n\nI want to offer a couple of gentle, practical steps you might consider. First, practice self-compassion. This is a tender time; treat yourself with the kindness you would offer a dear friend in crisis. Second, instead of trying to immediately rebuild a grand belief system, try focusing on small, concrete experiences of meaning. This could be moments of connection with nature, acts of kindness, or creative expression. Ask yourself: \"What feels authentically meaningful to me in this moment, even if it's small?\" Journaling these observations can be helpful.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge that this is a significant life transition, and working through it with a therapist or spiritual director can provide invaluable support. If your feelings of instability ever lead to thoughts of hopelessness or self-harm, please reach out to a crisis line or mental health professional immediately.\n\nYou are not alone in this search. Sometimes, what is \"real\" to hold onto emerges not from a perfect, unchanging doctrine, but from the quiet, resilient truth you discover within yourself as you heal. I am here to support you in that process.", "topic": "spirituality", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00376"}
{"id": "counsel_00873_aug_0", "question": "My partner and I were both raised in devout Muslim families but strayed from our faith for a period. He struggles with guilt over his own past actions and now judges mine harshly, particularly regarding relationships I had. His fixation on this is creating distance between us. What can I do to support him in finding self-forgiveness and focusing on our future together?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this deeply personal and challenging situation. It takes courage to navigate such complex feelings within a relationship, especially when they touch on faith, identity, and past experiences. I hear your pain in feeling judged by your partner, and I also hear your compassion in wanting to support him through his own guilt. This dual desire—to protect your own heart while helping him heal—is a testament to your care for him and your relationship.\n\nWhat you're describing is a common, yet painful, dynamic where one person's unresolved guilt can manifest as criticism of others. His harsh judgment of your past likely stems from his own internal struggle to forgive himself. It’s important to recognize that while you can be a source of support, you cannot be his sole source of healing. The work of self-forgiveness is ultimately his to do.\n\nA practical first step could be to initiate a calm, non-defensive conversation at a neutral time. Using \"I feel\" statements, you might express how his fixation creates distance, and gently reflect that his intensity seems connected to his own pain. You could ask, \"How can we, as partners, create a space where we both feel we can move forward from our pasts?\" Exploring this together may open a door.\n\nGiven the devout background you both share, it might be supportive to discuss if re-engaging with your faith in a new, compassionate way could be helpful—perhaps through study, prayer, or speaking with a progressive or well-regarded religious leader who emphasizes mercy and renewal over punishment.\n\nHowever, if his judgment continues to feel punishing or creates an unsafe emotional environment for you, it is crucial to prioritize your own well-being. I strongly encourage you both to consider seeking a couples counselor, preferably one with cultural and religious competency. A professional can provide a structured space to process this guilt and resentment, helping him to separate his journey from yours, so you can build a future together based on mutual respect, not on the shadows of the past.

How can I encourage her to practice compassion for both of us and be more present in our life now?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this deeply personal and challenging situation. It takes courage to acknowledge these strains within your marriage, and I appreciate you reaching out. What you're describing—the intersection of past experiences, spiritual upbringing, and present-day relationship dynamics—is complex and can feel very heavy to carry.\n\nFirst, I want to validate the pain both you and your wife are experiencing. It sounds like you both carry wounds from your pasts, and her criticism, while hurtful to you, may be a manifestation of her own internal struggle with shame and perhaps unresolved guilt from her questioning phase. The shared conservative background can sometimes make it difficult to integrate past actions with a current sense of self-worth and grace. Your desire to move toward mutual compassion is a beautiful and healthy goal for your marriage.\n\nGiven the depth of these issues, I must gently suggest that this may be a situation where professional support could be invaluable. A licensed marriage and family therapist, particularly one familiar with faith dynamics and issues of shame, could provide a safe, structured space for both of you to explore these feelings. They can facilitate conversations where you both feel heard, without the cycles of criticism and defensiveness that can happen at home.\n\nOn a practical level, you might initiate a gentle conversation at a calm moment. Using \"I feel\" statements, you could express your desire for you both to experience the freedom and forgiveness your faith teaches. You might say, \"I feel we are both carrying pain from our pasts, and I would like for us to find a way to extend the compassion we believe in to each other and ourselves.\" However, if these conversations consistently lead to increased conflict or distress, that is a clear sign to seek a therapist's guidance.\n\nYour hope to be more present together in your current life is important. With professional help to navigate the underlying shame and spiritual conflict, you can build a path toward that shared presence and deeper connection.

What you're describing takes immense courage to even begin to articulate, and I want to acknowledge the weight of the fear and isolation you must be feeling, caught between your deeply felt sense of self and the community and family you love. This is an incredibly difficult and painful position to be in, and your feelings are completely valid.\n\nFirst and foremost, your safety and well-being are the priority. Given your fear about your family's and community's potential reaction, it is crucial to carefully assess your physical, emotional, and financial safety before having any conversations that could put you at risk. There is no obligation to disclose anything before you are ready and in a secure environment. Please know that you do not have to navigate this alone.\n\nI strongly encourage you to seek support from a licensed therapist, preferably one with experience in gender identity and spiritual issues. They can provide a confidential, non-judgmental space for you to explore your feelings at your own pace and help you develop a plan for any future conversations. Connecting with supportive LGBTQ+ organizations, many of which have faith-based outreach or resources, can also help you find a community that understands both parts of your struggle.\n\nWhile I cannot make this path easy, I want you to know that your identity is not a sin. It is a core part of who you are. The journey to integrate your spiritual self and your gender identity is deeply personal. Please move forward with compassion for yourself, and prioritize building a network of affirming support, whether that is a therapist, a support group, or trusted friends, before considering discussions with those you fear may not understand.

I feel trapped between being true to myself and losing my family. What can I do?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. What you're describing is an incredibly difficult and painful position to be in—feeling caught between the essential need to live authentically and the deep love and connection you have for your family. It takes great courage to come to this self-understanding, and it's completely understandable to feel trapped, scared, and heartbroken by this potential conflict. Your feelings are valid.\n\nFirst, I want to emphasize that your safety is the top priority. Please consider: if you were to share this with your family, is there a risk of immediate harm, being forced to leave home, or being cut off financially? If so, creating a safety plan—which could include securing important documents, having a safe place to stay, and building a support network outside the family—becomes the essential first step. Your well-being must come first.\n\nWhen the time feels right for disclosure, that process is deeply personal. You are not obligated to tell anyone until you feel ready and secure. You might consider starting with the family member you feel might be most receptive, or by sharing in a written format that allows you to express your full thoughts without interruption. Remember, their initial reaction may not be their final one; understanding can take time, though this is not guaranteed.\n\nIt is crucial to build your own circle of support during this time. Seek out LGBTQ+ community centers, online support groups for non-binary individuals, and affirming spiritual communities if that is meaningful to you. Connecting with others who have navigated similar paths can provide immense strength.\n\nThis is a significant life transition, and you don't have to navigate it alone. I strongly encourage you to seek out a licensed therapist who specializes in gender identity and LGBTQ+ affirming care.

What you're describing—feeling disconnected from your own life and your true self—is a deeply significant experience, and it takes courage to acknowledge it. Many people go through periods where they feel they are living on autopilot or according to others' expectations, and the resulting sense of disconnection can be both unsettling and spiritually draining. Your feelings are completely valid.\n\nThis struggle to connect with your authentic self is often a signal from within, an invitation to explore and rediscover who you are beneath the roles and routines. As a starting point, I encourage you to gently create some space for self-reflection. This might look like setting aside quiet time for journaling, meditation, or simply spending time in nature. Ask yourself compassionate questions: \"When have I felt most alive or at peace?\" \"What values feel intrinsically mine, not borrowed from others?\" \"What small choice could I make today that feels more authentic?\" There is no need for immediate, grand answers; the goal is to begin a kind and curious dialogue with yourself.\n\nIt's important to note that while these feelings are a common part of the human and spiritual journey, they can sometimes be linked to underlying conditions like depression or anxiety. If this sense of disconnection is accompanied by persistent low mood, hopelessness, or it's significantly impacting your daily functioning, I strongly recommend connecting with a mental health professional. A therapist can provide a supportive space to navigate this exploration safely and deeply.\n\nYou have already taken the vital first step by recognizing this disconnect.

What you're describing is a deeply meaningful and common experience, especially as we move through different phases of life. It takes a great deal of self-awareness and courage to pause and acknowledge this feeling of not having fully explored your own beliefs and sense of meaning. Please know that your reflection is not a sign of being behind, but rather a sign of your readiness for a significant and personal exploration.\n\nThis journey is one of the most important you can undertake, and it’s perfectly okay that it’s unfolding now. As a counselor, my role is to support you in this discovery, not to provide the answers. I want to emphasize that exploring spirituality and meaning is a highly individual process; there is no single right path or timeline.\n\nTo offer some practical guidance, you might begin by gently creating space for curiosity. This isn't about finding immediate answers, but about asking yourself compassionate questions. You could try journaling prompts like, \"When have I felt a sense of awe or deep connection?\" or \"What values have consistently guided my actions, even without me naming them?\" Another step could be to explore different perspectives—through reading, conversations with people you admire, or even attending various community gatherings, not with pressure to join, but simply to observe what resonates.\n\nIt’s also important to acknowledge that this kind of existential exploration can sometimes bring up complex emotions. If you ever feel overwhelmed, or if these reflections lead to significant distress, please consider reaching out to a therapist for ongoing support.

I care for him deeply and he's been a source of stability after a difficult past, so I'm confused about what this means for our future.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing something so personal and vulnerable. It takes courage to examine these feelings, and I want you to know that your emotions—the worry, the confusion, and the care for your partner—are completely valid. Many people navigating faith, relationships, and personal boundaries experience this kind of inner conflict.\n\nFirst, I want to gently separate two things that seem to be intertwined in your mind: the strength of your relationship and a single stumble. A lapse in a boundary you set for yourself does not automatically mean your partner is not \"the one,\" nor does it define your worth or the relationship's potential. It is a human experience that can be a point of learning and growth for both of you. The fact that you care for him deeply and he has been a source of stability is significant. This moment can be an opportunity for an open, compassionate conversation with him about your shared values, intentions, and how you can support each other's spiritual goals moving forward.\n\nIt’s important to practice self-compassion. You mentioned a difficult past; sometimes when we are healing, our boundaries can soften as we seek connection. This doesn't mean you were \"not firm enough,\" but perhaps that you are navigating complex human needs.

Despite our youth, I truly believe he came into my life for a reason and helped me through a dark time. I love him, but I'm struggling with guilt and doubt about God's plan for us.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. I can hear how much you're struggling, and I want you to know that your feelings of guilt, doubt, and love are all valid and understandable. It's clear you hold your faith and your relationship with great care, and this experience has created a painful conflict between two important parts of your life.\n\nFirst, I want to gently normalize what you're experiencing. Many committed couples, even those who share a strong faith and intention to wait, navigate these powerful human feelings of attraction and love. Feeling temptation and acting on it does not erase your faith, your values, or the genuine love you have for your boyfriend. The guilt you feel speaks to your deep conscience, not to a permanent failing. It's also very common to project our guilt onto the relationship itself, leading to questions like \"Is he the right one?\" as a way to make sense of the pain.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, I encourage you and your boyfriend to have a compassionate, honest conversation about what happened. This isn't about assigning blame, but about understanding each other's feelings and reaffirming your shared values moving forward. You mentioned he helped you through a dark time—that history of support is significant. Consider also seeking guidance from a trusted spiritual advisor, like a campus minister or a priest known for their pastoral counseling. They can offer you the sacramental and theological perspective specific to your Catholic faith that I, as a mental health professional, cannot.\n\nRemember, a single event does not define your entire relationship or your spiritual journey. God's plan is often understood in hindsight, with grace covering our human imperfections. Be as kind to yourself as you would be to a friend in this situation.

They've threatened to stop paying my tuition if I don't end it. I love my partner and feel truly happy with them, but I'm constantly questioning if I'm betraying my spiritual identity or just finally becoming my own person.

You are navigating a profound developmental task—defining your own identity—while facing very real and serious consequences, which is an incredibly heavy burden to carry.\n\nFirst, I want to affirm that your feelings of happiness and your desire to become your own person are valid. So too are your feelings of spiritual connection and the pain caused by your parents' harsh words. This conflict doesn't necessarily mean you are abandoning your faith; it may signify a complex, personal journey of understanding what your spirituality means to you as an adult.

A therapist can provide a consistent, non-judgmental space to process these conflicting emotions, explore your identity, and navigate family dynamics without fear of repercussions.\n\nAs a next step, you might consider exploring campus resources for spiritual life or interfaith dialogue, which could offer supportive perspectives. In the short term, practicing self-compassion is vital. The labels you've been given are reflections of your parents' fear and disappointment, not your worth.

It takes courage to articulate the tension you're experiencing, and I want to first validate how real and difficult this is. Feeling caught between the foundational beliefs of your family and the authentic life you are building for yourself is profoundly distressing. The feelings of guilt, confusion, and fear of loss—loss of family, financial stability, and even spiritual standing—are completely understandable in this situation.\n\nWhat you're describing is a pivotal moment of identity development, which often involves integrating the values you were raised with and the values you discover for yourself. It is not necessarily a matter of one being your \"true self\" and the other being false. This is a process of synthesis, though it can feel like a撕裂 (tearing apart) right now. The pressure from your parents, including the ultimatum about financial support, adds a very concrete layer of stress to an already emotionally complex situation.\n\nAs a next step, I encourage you to create some space for gentle reflection, separate from the immediate pressure. You might ask yourself: What aspects of your faith remain meaningful to you personally? What does a respectful, loving relationship look like to you, and how does your current partnership align with that? Exploring these questions for yourself, perhaps through journaling, can provide clarity.\n\nIt is also important to consider practical safety. The threat of withdrawn financial support is significant. Could you begin to explore resources for greater independence, such as part-time work or alternative housing options, to reduce this pressure point? This isn't about rejecting your family, but about creating the emotional and practical space to make choices that are yours.\n\nFinally, I want to gently suggest that navigating this kind of family and faith transition is exactly the kind of work that ongoing counseling can support. A therapist can provide a confidential, non-judgmental space to process these conflicting loyalties and help you build a cohesive sense of self. You are not alone in this journey, and seeking support is a sign of strength, not defiance.\n\nPlease remember, your worth is not conditional on any single choice you make.

It's completely understandable to feel a sense of struggle in these situations. Navigating diverse spiritual practices, especially within the intimate and emotionally charged setting of a family wedding, can bring up complex feelings—perhaps a mix of respect, curiosity, uncertainty, or even a sense of being an outsider. Your desire to be respectful while managing your own comfort is a sign of great sensitivity, and I want to validate that.\n\nAs a starting point, I encourage a gentle exploration of your own feelings. What specifically feels challenging? Is it a fear of participating in an unfamiliar ritual, a concern about offending someone, or perhaps an internal conflict if practices differ from your own beliefs? Naming this can be empowering.\n\nOn a practical level, preparation can greatly reduce anxiety. Before the event, you might consider reaching out to the couple or a close family member to kindly ask about the ceremony's structure. Simply knowing what to expect can help. During the service, view your role as an observer and a supportive guest. It is perfectly acceptable to participate passively—standing or sitting respectfully while others pray or sing, for example, without feeling pressured to say words that conflict with your conscience. Your silent, attentive presence is a profound gesture of love and respect.\n\nRemember, your primary role at a wedding is to witness and celebrate the couple's union. Focusing on that shared joy can often be a unifying anchor amidst diverse practices.

Feeling conflicted during family celebrations is completely understandable; you're navigating the delicate space between your own spiritual identity and the desire to connect with your partner's family. It's normal to feel a sense of dissonance or even loneliness in these moments.\n\nAs a counselor, I want to emphasize that your personal beliefs are valid and deserve respect. A helpful first step might be to have an open and gentle conversation with your partner about these feelings when you're both in a calm, private setting. Discuss what these traditions mean to their family, how you each envision navigating these differences long-term, and what support you might need from each other. This isn't about changing anyone's beliefs, but about finding mutual understanding and creating a plan that honors both of your backgrounds.\n\nIn the moment, you might consider practical strategies like participating in a respectful, observational way that doesn't compromise your own values—perhaps by focusing on the universal themes of gratitude, family, or peace that many traditions share. It can also be powerful to privately set a simple intention for yourself before the gathering, such as \"I am here to show love to my partner and their family,\" which can serve as an anchor if you feel unsettled.\n\nIf these feelings are causing significant distress or tension in your relationship, seeking support from a couples counselor or a therapist specializing in intercultural or interfaith dynamics could be very beneficial. Please remember, your experience matters, and finding a path that feels authentic to you is an important part of building a healthy, integrated life with your partner.", "topic": "spirituality", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00382"}

He screams insults at me, telling me I'm worthless and useless. He insists it's just him 'blowing off steam' and that real abuse is physical, not verbal. But the tirades are becoming more frequent and the insults cut deeper every time.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. What you are describing sounds incredibly painful and deeply distressing. It takes courage to voice these experiences, and I want you to know that your feelings are completely valid. The emotional toll of being repeatedly screamed at and insulted by your partner is very real and very serious.\n\nFirst, I want to be clear: verbal and emotional abuse is real abuse. The assertion that abuse is only physical is incorrect. Being told you are worthless and being used as a target for someone else's anger is a form of psychological violence that erodes your sense of self and safety. You do not deserve this, and his behavior is not your fault.\n\nYour safety and well-being are my primary concern. The fact that these tirades are becoming more frequent is a significant red flag. I strongly encourage you to connect with a professional who can provide dedicated support. A local domestic violence agency can be a vital resource; they understand the dynamics of emotional abuse and can help you create a safety plan, even if the threat isn't currently physical. They offer confidential support and can help you explore your options.\n\nFor now, please consider these steps: When an outburst begins, if it is safe to do so, move to a room with an exit and avoid engaging. If possible, identify a trusted friend or family member you can check in with. Start documenting the incidents with dates and details in a secure place. This can be helpful for clarity and, if needed, for legal purposes later.\n\nYou are not alone. What you are experiencing is not \"blowing off steam\"—it is abuse, and support is available to help you navigate this situation. My role here is limited, but I can urge you to reach out to the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-7233 for immediate, specialized guidance from advocates who are trained to help.", "topic": "domestic-violence", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00407"}

What you're describing sounds incredibly painful and exhausting. Your feelings are completely valid. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that something that is being dismissed as \"just words\" is having such a profound and damaging effect on you. Emotional and psychological abuse, including cruel, degrading, and escalating verbal attacks, is very real and deeply harmful. It is absolutely a form of domestic violence, regardless of whether physical violence is present. The fact that you feel \"completely broken down\" is a significant indicator of the severity of this abuse.\n\nYour safety and well-being are the priority here. The escalation you've noted is a serious concern. Abuse often intensifies over time, and the goal of such language is to control and diminish you. It is not your fault, and you do not deserve to be treated this way, no matter what stress he is under.\n\nMy first and most important recommendation is to connect with a professional who specializes in domestic violence. They can provide you with confidential support and safety planning. I strongly encourage you to reach out to the National Domestic Violence Hotline. They are available 24/7 at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or via text at TEXT: \"START\" to 88788. They can help you assess your situation, explore options, and connect you with local resources, all confidentially.\n\nIn the short term, please consider your safety. If you feel unsafe during an episode, is there a safe room you can go to, or could you leave to go to a trusted friend or family member's house?

This person has a history of physically restraining her, destroying her property to limit her freedom, and becoming violent. Despite multiple attempts to leave, she keeps returning, believing in promises of change. Recently, after we took a trip together, her partner has become fixated on the idea that we were both unfaithful. He's now spreading these accusations to my own partner, trying to damage my relationship as well.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this deeply concerning and painful situation. It's clear you care deeply for your friend, and it's completely understandable to feel worried, frustrated, and even fearful as you watch this unfold. It's also very distressing that his behavior is now directly impacting you and your own relationship. Your feelings of alarm are valid and important.\n\nThe situation you've described involves multiple forms of abuse—emotional, psychological, and physical—and it is escalating. The most critical point to recognize is that your friend's safety, and potentially your own, is at risk. When abuse involves physical restraint, destruction of property, and violence, the danger is significant. His new tactic of spreading accusations is a classic abuse strategy to isolate your friend and undermine her support system, which now includes you.\n\nAs a counselor, my primary ethical duty is to emphasize safety. I strongly encourage you to gently discuss a safety plan with your friend. This could involve helping her identify a safe place to go, having a bag packed, and saving the number for the National Domestic Violence Hotline (800-799-7233 or text START to 88788). They offer 24/7, confidential support and can help her create a personalized plan. It is crucial to support her autonomy; leaving is a process, and she must feel in control of her decisions to avoid further danger.\n\nFor your own well-being and relationship, consider setting a firm boundary. You might calmly and clearly tell your partner, and potentially the abuser if safe to do so, that the accusations are false and part of a pattern of control. Document any threatening communications. Supporting someone in this situation is emotionally taxing. Please ensure you are also seeking support, perhaps through a therapist or a support hotline for friends and family, to navigate your own feelings and maintain your personal boundaries during this challenging time. Your compassion is a lifeline for your friend, but your safety and stability matter too.", "topic": "domestic-violence", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00408"}

The situation has now spilled over to affect me; after we attended a family event, he became paranoid about infidelity and is making false claims about me to my husband, attempting to create conflict in my home.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this deeply concerning and painful situation. It takes a lot of strength to reach out, and I want to first acknowledge the immense stress, fear, and frustration you must be feeling—both for your sister's safety and now for the stability of your own home. It is completely understandable to feel overwhelmed when the abuse has extended its reach to impact you directly.\n\nYour sister’s situation is extremely high-risk. The combination of an unmanaged psychiatric condition, physical violence, isolation, and now paranoid accusations creates a volatile environment where safety is the paramount concern. It is common for survivors to vacillate about leaving; the cycle of hope and fear is powerful and is often a tool of control used by the abuser. Your support is invaluable, but this situation requires specialized, professional intervention.\n\nMy primary recommendation is to connect immediately with the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233 or text START to 88788). They are experts in safety planning and can provide guidance tailored to your sister’s specific circumstances, including how to support her without compromising your own safety. Given that his false accusations are now targeting you, it is crucial to document these interactions. Keep a factual log of dates, times, and the nature of the claims. Consider having a calm, clear conversation with your husband to ensure you are a united front against these divisive tactics.\n\nPlease prioritize your own emotional well-being. Supporting someone in an abusive relationship is a marathon, not a sprint. Setting boundaries—like limiting direct contact with her spouse—is not only acceptable but necessary for your own family's health. You cannot force your sister to leave, but you can maintain a lifeline of non-judgmental support for her while safeguarding your own household.

Your feelings are completely valid.\n\nI want to start by acknowledging a very important point: the escalation of arguments, belittling language, and threats to leave you stranded are serious concerns. These behaviors are not a normal or healthy part of a relationship, even during stressful times like job loss. Your safety and emotional well-being, and that of your child, are the absolute priority.\n\nIt is a positive step that your partner has agreed to therapy. However, given the dynamic you've described, I strongly recommend that you seek individual counseling for yourself first. A therapist can be a crucial support for you, help you process your experience, and develop a safety plan. They can also help you navigate the language barrier concern, as many therapists can work with interpreters or have strategies to ensure you are heard. When considering couples therapy, it's vital to proceed with caution; it is not recommended in situations involving intimidation or threats, as it can sometimes escalate risk.\n\nFor now, please consider these steps:\n1. **Safety Planning:** Identify a safe place you and your child can go if tensions escalate. Keep important documents, some cash, and a bag with essentials accessible.\n2. **Local Support:** Please contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or visit thehotline.org.

Your safety and your baby's safety, both emotional and physical, are the absolute priority. When he demands you leave your shared home during fights, it creates an unstable and frightening environment for you and your child.\n\nYour desire to try counseling is understandable, but it's important to know that couples counseling is not typically recommended in relationships where there is a controlling or abusive power dynamic, as it can sometimes escalate risk or be used to further manipulate.

Your mother's threats regarding legal custody are a significant source of pressure. I strongly encourage you to connect with a professional who can provide specific guidance on your legal rights as a teenager. A school counselor, a social worker, or a local domestic violence agency can often help navigate these situations and may connect you with legal advocacy. You do not have to manage this alone.\n\nRegarding your boyfriend's family, it is deeply hurtful to feel judged and misunderstood. You might consider, when you feel ready, having a one-on-one conversation with your boyfriend to share what you feel comfortable with. His support could be crucial. However, protecting your emotional energy is also valid; you are not obligated to justify your life experiences to anyone.\n\nThe core of this is building your own support system. Your aunt's home seems to be a place of safety—lean into that. Continue to prioritize your own stability, your education, and your healing. What you are facing is complex, and working with a therapist could provide you with a dedicated space to process the trauma and develop strategies to set boundaries with both your mother and your boyfriend's family.

Please know that your feelings are valid, and this is a real challenge that deserves compassionate attention.\n\nFirst and foremost, it's important to recognize that recurring nightmares like this are often our mind's way of signaling that something needs to be addressed. They can be linked to stress, anxiety, unresolved emotions, or past experiences. While we can explore some strategies here, I want to gently emphasize that ongoing nightmares are a strong reason to consider speaking with a professional, like a therapist or counselor, who can work with you one-on-one. They can help you safely explore potential underlying causes and develop a personalized treatment plan, which may include approaches like Imagery Rehearsal Therapy, which is specifically designed for nightmares.\n\nFor immediate coping, establishing a calming bedtime routine can be helpful. This might involve gentle stretching, deep breathing, or listening to soothing music before bed. Keep a notepad and a soft light by your bed.

My neurologist says it's not linked to my past head injury, but it really disrupts my rest.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. What you're describing sounds both unsettling and disruptive, especially when it interferes with your much-needed rest. It's completely understandable to feel concerned when experiencing sensations that feel outside of your control, and it's wise that you've already consulted a neurologist to rule out certain causes. Hearing that it's not linked to your past head injury is reassuring from a medical standpoint, but it doesn't make the experience itself any less distressing.\n\nWhat you're describing could be related to a few different things that occur in the transitional state between wakefulness and sleep. The sensation of floating or being outside yourself can be a form of mild sleep paralysis or a hypnagogic hallucination, which are generally harmless but can be frightening. The automatic swallowing might be a separate somatic anxiety response or a heightened awareness of a normal bodily function as you drift off. Since this is impacting your well-being, a good next step would be to discuss these specific symptoms with a mental health professional, such as a therapist who specializes in sleep disorders or anxiety. They can help you explore any potential connections to stress or sleep hygiene.\n\nIn the meantime, let's focus on some practical strategies to help you feel more grounded and secure at bedtime. When you notice these sensations beginning, try a grounding technique: name five things you can see, four things you can feel, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This can gently redirect your focus.

The sensation of detachment from your body, often referred to as depersonalization, coupled with an involuntary physical response like swallowing, can be very alarming. Even though you've been informed it's not related to an existing medical condition, the impact on your well-being is real and deserves attention.\n\nGiven the physical nature of the swallowing, it is crucial to continue collaborating with medical professionals to rule out any neurological or sleep-specific causes. I would gently encourage you to consider a consultation with a sleep specialist or a neurologist, if you haven't already. They can perform assessments that are outside my scope as a counselor, ensuring all potential physiological bases are explored.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, sensations like these can sometimes be linked to periods of heightened stress, anxiety, or fatigue. While we work on understanding the root cause, we can also develop some practical coping strategies for the moment it happens. Grounding techniques can be very helpful to counter the feeling of detachment. When you feel the sensation begin, you could try focusing on the physical feeling of your breath moving in and out, or gently pressing your feet into the mattress and noticing the sensation of the sheets.

To counter sleeping through alarms, try placing your alarm across the room and using a sunrise-simulating lamp if possible. These are tools to help regulate your nervous system.\n\nMost importantly, you should not have to navigate this alone. I strongly recommend connecting with support resources at your college. The counseling center is an excellent place to start. Speaking with a therapist can provide you with a confidential space to process your feelings about your mom and develop long-term coping strategies. Additionally, look for support groups like Al-Anon or similar campus groups for students affected by a family member's addiction. These communities can provide understanding and reduce the isolation you're feeling.\n\nYour well-being is the foundation for everything else.

What can I do to stop this cycle?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing what you've been going through. It makes complete sense that you're feeling this way. You have been carrying an immense amount of stress and grief—the painful divorce, your family's financial strain, and your sibling's diagnosis are profound, life-altering events. It is not at all surprising that your mind and body are expressing this distress through sleep difficulties and nightmares. Please know that your feelings of being overwhelmed and hopeless are a valid response to an overwhelming situation.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge the strength you showed by finding a coping strategy like swimming. It's significant that it helped for a time, and its recent diminished effect might be a signal that the underlying emotional weight needs more direct attention. The nightmares of being trapped and suffocating are powerful metaphors for the feelings your conscious mind is processing.\n\nWhile I can offer some guidance here, this pattern of insomnia and vivid nightmares, especially following such significant trauma and loss, is something I strongly encourage you to discuss with a mental health professional. A therapist can work with you to safely process the grief and anxiety, and techniques like Imagery Rehearsal Therapy (IRT) are specifically effective for trauma-related nightmares.\n\nFor immediate steps, consider re-engaging with swimming, as routine physical activity is crucial. Establish a consistent, calming pre-sleep ritual: one hour before bed, disconnect from screens, try deep breathing or a guided meditation focused on safety and calm. Keep a notepad by your bed; if you wake from a nightmare, write down a new, peaceful ending for it. This can help reclaim a sense of control.\n\nMost importantly, if you ever have thoughts of harming yourself, please contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline immediately. You do not have to navigate this alone. Reaching out for professional support is a courageous and vital next step toward healing your sleep and finding peace.", "topic": "sleep-improvement", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00452"}
{"id": "counsel_00886_aug_1", "question": "For months now, it takes me forever to actually get to sleep, and I'm plagued by recurring nightmares about being chased and unable to breathe, which jolt me awake. This all seemed to begin after the end of a significant relationship. I was also dealing with my mom's business failing and my dad's ongoing health issues. The stress made everything feel pointless. I found some relief through regular gym workouts, but the last few weeks, the sleep problems and bad dreams have returned without any clear trigger. How should I address this sudden relapse?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing what you've been going through. It sounds incredibly difficult to be dealing with such persistent sleep issues and distressing nightmares, especially after you had found some relief. It makes complete sense that you're feeling concerned and frustrated by this sudden relapse. Please know that your experience is a common and understandable response to the significant cumulative stress you've endured—the relationship ending, your family's struggles, and the feeling of pointlessness you described. Our minds and bodies often process unresolved stress and grief long after the initial events, and sleep is one of the first places this shows up.\n\nThe return of these symptoms, even without a clear new trigger, is an important signal from your nervous system that there may be underlying anxiety or trauma that needs to be processed. While the gym workouts are an excellent and healthy coping strategy for managing stress, they may not be fully addressing the root emotional material that is surfacing in your dreams. The themes of being chased and unable to breathe are very evocative of feelings of pressure, threat, and helplessness.\n\nGiven the intensity and recurrence of these nightmares, I strongly encourage you to consider connecting with a mental health professional. A therapist, particularly one trained in modalities like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) or trauma-focused approaches, can provide you with a safe space to process these experiences and give you specific tools to improve sleep and manage nightmares. They can help you develop a structured wind-down routine, techniques for \"rescripting\" nightmares, and ways to address the anxiety that fuels sleep onset issues.\n\nIn the immediate term, you might find it helpful to keep a notepad by your bed. If you wake from a nightmare, briefly jot down the dream or any feelings, then physically set the notebook aside as a symbolic way of setting the worry aside for the night. Also, try to gently reintroduce consistency with your sleep schedule and wind-down routine. You have already shown great strength in navigating these challenges, and seeking support for this next step is a powerful act of self-care.

Waking up that many times each night sounds incredibly frustrating and exhausting. It's completely understandable that you would be seeking some relief, as fragmented sleep like this can really take a toll on your energy, mood, and overall well-being. You're not alone in experiencing this, and it's a very common issue that many people bring to counseling.\n\nAs a counselor, I want to first acknowledge that while I can offer guidance and support, persistent sleep disturbances can have both psychological and physiological causes. It's often a very wise step to consult with your primary care physician or a sleep specialist. They can help rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome, which are important to address for your overall health and safety.\n\nIn our work together, we could explore several practical strategies. We might look at your \"sleep hygiene\"—the habits and environment surrounding your sleep. This includes establishing a consistent wind-down routine, ensuring your bedroom is cool, dark, and quiet, and limiting screen time before bed. We could also explore mindfulness or relaxation techniques to help calm a racing mind if you find yourself awake. Keeping a simple sleep log can be very helpful, noting what you did before bed, when you woke up, and any thoughts or feelings you had, as this can reveal patterns for us to address.\n\nPlease know that this is a manageable issue. My role is to support you in understanding the potential stressors or habits contributing to this and to help you build a toolkit for better rest.

Waking up multiple times throughout the night is incredibly frustrating and exhausting, and it can really take a toll on your mood, energy, and overall well-being. Please know that your experience is valid, and it's very common for people to struggle with fragmented sleep, especially during times of stress or change.\n\nAs a counselor, I want to acknowledge that while I can offer guidance on managing the thoughts and anxieties that often accompany sleep issues, persistent sleep fragmentation can sometimes have underlying medical causes, such as sleep apnea, hormone imbalances, or chronic pain. Therefore, a crucial first step I often recommend is scheduling a check-up with your primary care physician or a sleep specialist. They can help rule out any physiological factors, which is important for your safety and for creating an effective treatment plan.\n\nIn tandem with that medical consultation, we can explore some practical strategies to improve your sleep hygiene and relationship with rest. A helpful approach is to focus on consistency: try to wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends, to regulate your body clock. When you do wake up at night, avoid looking at the clock, as this can increase anxiety. Instead of lying in bed feeling frustrated, practice the \"15-minute rule\": if you're awake for more than 15-20 minutes, get out of bed and do a quiet, non-stimulating activity in dim light (like reading a physical book) until you feel sleepy again. This helps reassociate your bed with sleep rather than wakefulness.\n\nLastly, let's be compassionate with yourself. The pressure to \"get perfect sleep\" can itself be disruptive. We can work together on techniques to manage any racing thoughts or worries that may be surfacing at night. You're taking an important step by addressing this, and I'm here to support you through the process.", "topic": "sleep-improvement", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00453"}

Grieving is a deeply personal and challenging process, and it is completely understandable that you are struggling to cope. It takes courage to reach out for support, and I commend you for taking this step, especially while navigating the practical concern of cost.\n\nFirst, please know that your feelings—whether they are sadness, anger, numbness, or a mix of everything—are valid. Grief has no timeline. It is important to allow yourself to feel these emotions without judgment. Talking about your grandmother, writing down memories, or even creating a small ritual in her honor can be helpful ways to process your loss.\n\nRegarding free resources, there are several excellent options. Many communities have **bereavement support groups** offered through local hospitals, hospice centers, or community centers. These are often free and provide connection with others who understand. Online, organizations like **The Dougy Center** and **GriefShare** offer directories to find local groups, as well as online resources and forums.\n\nYou can also explore **warmlines**—non-crisis peer support lines for emotional listening.

What you're experiencing—this overwhelming grief—is a completely normal and human response to losing someone so important. The pain can feel all-consuming, especially just a few weeks in, and it takes tremendous courage to reach out and look for support, especially while navigating practical concerns like finances. Please know that your feelings are valid, and seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\nGiven your financial constraints, there are several excellent low-to-no-cost options to explore. First, I strongly recommend contacting local hospice organizations. Even if your father was not in hospice care, most hospices offer free grief support groups and individual counseling to anyone in the community. Your local Area Agency on Aging can also provide referrals. Secondly, many community mental health centers operate on a sliding scale fee based on your income, making professional counseling very affordable.\n\nConsider reaching out to **The National Alliance for Grieving Children (NAGC)** or the **Grief Recovery Method**; they often have directories of free support groups. Online, **The Dougy Center** provides excellent resources. Your employer may also have an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) offering a limited number of free counseling sessions.\n\nAs you navigate this, please be gentle with yourself. Grief has no timeline.

During the day I manage, but when I'm alone in the evening, the quiet brings back all the happy times we shared, and I'm overwhelmed with sobbing. I feel like I should be 'over it' by now, so why do these crying spells still hit me so hard at night?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. First, I want to acknowledge the profound loss you've experienced and the courage it takes to voice this ongoing pain. What you're describing—managing during the day but being overwhelmed by grief in the evening quiet—is a very common and understandable experience. Grief doesn't follow a linear timeline, and there is no \"should\" about when to be \"over it.\" The love you had for your father and best friend is enduring, so it makes sense that the pain of their absence is enduring too. These nighttime crying spells are not a sign of weakness or failure; they are a testament to the depth of your connection to them.\n\nIt's important to recognize that nighttime often removes the distractions of the day, allowing feelings we've held at bay to surface. This can feel like a sudden flood, but it is your heart and mind processing this significant loss in their own time.\n\nFor practical guidance, you might consider gently structuring your evening to create a sense of soft transition. This could involve a brief ritual, like lighting a candle and spending 15 minutes intentionally remembering them, writing in a journal, or listening to calming music. The goal isn't to avoid the feelings, but to create a container for them so they feel less overwhelming. Also, please consider if speaking with a grief counselor or therapist could provide you with a dedicated space to navigate this. They can offer tailored strategies for these intense moments.\n\nYour feelings are valid and important.

I function normally at work, but as soon as I try to wind down for bed, vivid memories surface and I break down in tears. The intensity of this nightly grief surprises and exhausts me. Is it normal for the sadness to feel this fresh after so much time has passed?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. What you're describing sounds incredibly painful and exhausting. First, I want to validate what you're feeling: yes, it is entirely normal for grief to surface with this kind of intensity, even after a decade. Grief doesn't follow a linear timeline, and the quiet, vulnerable moments at the end of the day are often when our minds and hearts finally allow the feelings we've managed during the day to come forward. The fact that you function at work doesn't diminish the depth of your loss; it speaks to your strength, but it also means that grief may be finding its only outlet in those private, still moments.\n\nThe surprise and exhaustion you feel are important signals. They suggest that this nightly pattern, while understandable, is taking a significant toll on your well-being. This is a sign that it may be helpful to explore new ways of relating to this grief with some professional support. A therapist specializing in grief and loss can provide a compassionate space to process these vivid memories and help you develop strategies to soothe your nervous system before bed.\n\nAs a practical step for tonight, you might consider gently shifting your bedtime routine. Could you create a 30-minute \"wind-down\" period that includes a comforting, non-stimulating activity? This could be listening to calm music, reading a light book, or practicing a simple breathing exercise. The goal isn't to avoid the grief, but to create a buffer of calm so that if the memories arise, you're in a slightly more grounded state to meet them. Please be gentle with yourself.

After my father passed, the grief has been overwhelming, and my brother constantly reminds me of the arguments we used to have, which makes everything feel worse.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. What you're describing sounds incredibly painful, and I want to start by validating that your feelings of overwhelming grief and despair are a natural, though deeply difficult, response to such a significant loss. Losing a father is a profound event, and it makes complete sense that you are struggling. The added layer of your brother reminding you of past arguments can compound that grief with feelings of guilt or regret, which is an exceptionally heavy burden to carry.\n\nIt is important to recognize that grief is not linear, and there is no \"right\" way to navigate it. However, the intensity of the despair you're describing concerns me, and it may be a signal that you could benefit from additional support. As a counselor, I must gently suggest that speaking with a licensed therapist in your area, particularly one who specializes in grief and loss, could provide you with a dedicated, safe space to process these complex emotions without the added dynamic of family history.\n\nFor now, I might offer a few practical steps you could consider. First, you might find it helpful to gently set a boundary with your brother. You could say something like, \"I know we both miss Dad in our own ways, but right now, revisiting our past arguments is too painful for me. Can we focus on sharing a positive memory instead?\" Second, try to create small moments of self-compassion each day. This could be as simple as writing a letter to your father to express things left unsaid, or spending time in a place that brings you a sense of peace. Please remember that despair can sometimes cloud our perspective on the future.

{"id": "counsel_00890_aug_1", "question": "This past year has been filled with such emptiness. Losing my spouse intensified all my sadness, and now my adult child frequently points out the ways I could have been more present, which adds another layer of pain.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. What you're describing sounds profoundly difficult—to be navigating the deep emptiness of grief after losing your spouse, while also carrying the added weight of these painful conversations with your adult child. It makes complete sense that you feel this as an intensification of your sadness. Grief is heavy enough on its own without having another layer of pain placed upon it.\n\nFirst, I want to validate that your feelings of emptiness and sadness are a normal, though incredibly painful, response to such a significant loss. The first year, with all its \"firsts\" without your spouse, is often especially arduous. When criticism or regret is introduced, even if unintentionally, it can feel like the grief is being compounded, making it harder to find your footing.\n\nIn a situation like this, it can be helpful to gently separate these two sources of pain. Your grief deserves its own space to be honored and processed. The dynamic with your adult child, which involves past perceptions and current hurts, is a separate—though interconnected—matter. When you feel ready, it might be beneficial to have a calm conversation with your child, not to debate the past, but to express how their comments are affecting you in your present grief. You could say something like, \"I hear you, and I want to understand your feelings. Right now, while I'm grieving, those reflections are very hard for me to hold. Can we find a way to talk about this that doesn't deepen the hurt for both of us?\"\n\nI strongly encourage you to seek additional support. A grief support group can provide companionship with others who truly understand this journey, and individual counseling could offer a safe space to process both the loss and these complex family dynamics. Please be gentle with yourself. You are enduring one of life's hardest experiences, and self-compassion is not a luxury right now—it's a necessity. If you ever have thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out immediately to a crisis line or 911.

{"id": "counsel_00891_aug_0", "question": "I keep romanticizing my college years and the friendships I had then. Looking back, it all seems perfect compared to my current routine life, and it leaves me with a deep sense of longing and emptiness. How can I stop comparing my past to my present and find fulfillment in where I am now?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. What you're describing is a very common and deeply human experience. It makes complete sense to look back on a formative, vibrant period like college with a sense of nostalgia and even grief. Those years are often packed with intense social connections, new discoveries, and a clear sense of purpose, which can starkly contrast with the more routine demands of adult life. Your feelings of longing and emptiness are valid, and it's important to honor them as a sign that connection and meaning are vital to you.\n\nWhat you're noticing is often a process of selective memory—our minds have a beautiful, yet sometimes unhelpful, way of smoothing over the stresses and uncertainties of the past, leaving us with a polished, \"perfect\" version to compare to our present, which includes all its mundane complexities. This comparison can rob us of the richness available to us now.\n\nA helpful first step is to gently challenge that romanticized narrative. You might try writing down not just the wonderful memories, but also the challenges you faced in college—the exams, the heartbreaks, the insecurities. This creates a more balanced picture. Then, we can explore what specific elements you miss most. Is it the constant social interaction, the intellectual stimulation, or the sense of possibility? Identifying these core needs is key.\n\nOnce identified, we can work on integrating those elements into your current life. This could involve joining a book club or taking a class to rekindle intellectual curiosity, scheduling regular friend meet-ups to prioritize connection, or volunteering for a cause that gives you a renewed sense of purpose. It's about translating the *essence* of what you valued then into your present-day context.\n\nThis process takes time and self-compassion. If these feelings of emptiness become overwhelming or significantly impact your daily functioning, I would gently encourage you to consider speaking with a counselor in your area. They can provide a supportive space to process this grief and collaboratively build a meaningful path forward.

What you're describing is a deeply human and poignant experience. It makes complete sense that the loss of your grandmother would bring these vivid memories to the surface. The warmth and connection you felt in those family gatherings are a testament to the love she helped cultivate, and it's natural that their absence now creates a profound sense of sadness and quiet. Please know that holding both the beauty of those memories and the pain of their loss is a sign of how much she and those times meant to you.\n\nHonoring those memories while engaging with the present is a delicate balance, and it's something we can work on together. One approach is to consider creating a dedicated \"memory time\" in your day. For a few minutes, allow yourself to fully immerse in one of those warm recollections. Then, gently transition by asking yourself, \"What is one small thing I can appreciate or notice right now?\" It could be the sunlight in the room, a comforting taste, or a simple task. This isn't about replacing the past, but about training your mind to also register goodness in the present moment.\n\nYou might also find meaning in a concrete act of honor—perhaps preparing her favorite recipe, sharing stories with another family member, or volunteering with an organization she cared about. These actions can bridge the past and present, carrying her values forward.\n\nGrief has its own timeline, and if you find the sadness persistently overwhelming or isolating, seeking additional support from a grief counselor or support group can be incredibly beneficial.

What you're describing is an incredibly complex and painful form of grief, and I want to start by validating the weight of what you're carrying.

It is a testament to your care that you are wrestling with these emotions now.\n\nFirst, I want to gently remind you that setting a boundary to protect your own well-being was not an act of abandonment; it was an act of survival. Caring for someone who is critical and manipulative is emotionally exhausting, and creating distance is often the only healthy option left.

It is very common in complicated relationships for grief to be intertwined with guilt, relief, and anger, all at once. Please try to hold space for all these feelings without judgment.\n\nA crucial step in processing this is to separate the natural progression of her decline from your very human need for self-preservation. Her passing was the result of her own health journey, not a consequence of your boundary. To move through this guilt, I encourage you to consider a few practical steps. You might try writing a letter to your mother, expressing everything you wish you could say—the love, the hurt, the apologies, and the good memories. This can be a powerful way to externalize your emotions. Also, please consider seeking out a grief counselor or a support group for caregivers. They can provide a dedicated space to untangle these complicated emotions with professional guidance, which is highly recommended in situations like this.\n\nYour grief is real, and your need for peace is valid.

It makes complete sense that you are wrestling with these \"what ifs.\" After so many years of focusing on your spouse's needs, it is a painful transition to now confront your own emotional survival.\n\nWhat you are experiencing is a form of complicated grief, layered with caregiver burnout and moral injury—the distress that comes from feeling you may have acted against your own values. It is crucial to understand that chronic illness follows its own trajectory. While the timing feels tragically connected, you cannot know that your departure accelerated their passing. You made an agonizing choice to preserve your own well-being after decades of support, which is a human and valid response to an unsustainable situation.\n\nTo cope, I gently encourage you to seek a therapist specializing in grief and caregiver trauma. In a therapeutic space, you can safely unpack this guilt, separate fact from feeling, and begin to honor both your spouse's journey and your own. Practically, you might start a journal to write letters to your spouse or to your own feelings of guilt. This can externalize the internal dialogue.

I'm desperate to save our family and would overlook his emotional affair if he recommits.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. What you're describing sounds incredibly painful and isolating, carrying this grief for a decade while also trying to hold your marriage together. It's completely understandable to feel desperate to save your family; that speaks to your deep love and commitment. The cyclical nature of his withdrawal around anniversaries, and now this new development with his friend, adds layers of hurt and uncertainty to an already profound loss.\n\nFirst, I want to validate that your grief, and your need for a partner in that grief, are just as important as his. The loss of your son created a wound in your relationship, and it seems you've both been coping in very different, and now disconnected, ways. His emotional distance and the threat of leaving are likely expressions of his own unbearable pain, but that does not make their impact on you any less real or damaging.\n\nWhile your willingness to overlook the emotional affair to preserve the family is a testament to your strength, I am concerned that this approach may further erode your own well-being and the marriage's foundation. \"Overlooking\" often means burying legitimate hurt, which can lead to resentment. The core issue isn't necessarily this friend, but the decade of unresolved, shared grief that has created a chasm between you.\n\nFor this reason, I strongly recommend seeking professional help together. A therapist specializing in grief and couples counseling can provide a safe, structured space for you both to express your pain, perhaps for the first time in years, and to learn how to support each other again. You cannot do this heavy work alone. I would also encourage you to seek individual support for yourself, as you need and deserve a dedicated space to process your own journey.

Your partner's withdrawal and the extreme suggestions of separation around the anniversary are likely expressions of an overwhelming, reactivated pain—a way of pushing away the source of a shared hurt when the hurt itself feels unmanageable.\n\nYour willingness to forgive is a testament to your strength, but I am gently concerned that \"fixing\" this may be beyond what the two of you can do alone at this point. The introduction of a third party, the coworker, significantly complicates the grief process and adds a layer of relational injury. While the coworker may provide a listening ear, it has created a dynamic that often deepens the marital rift.\n\nThe most actionable and crucial step I can recommend is to seek professional support, both individually and as a couple. A therapist specializing in grief and trauma can provide a safe, neutral space. For you, it can help process your own grief and the secondary trauma of your partner's cycles. For your partner, it can offer the compassionate listening they seek, but within a healthy boundary. For your marriage, it can help you both learn to reconnect with and listen to each other's unique grief, rebuilding trust. This pattern has been recurring for years; breaking it requires new tools and a guided, supportive framework. Please consider reaching out to a therapist or a grief support group for bereaved parents.

I've tried throwing myself into work and even moved cities, but the emptiness just follows me everywhere.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing something so profoundly painful with me. What you are describing is an immense and devastating loss. The cruel juxtaposition of planning a funeral on what should have been your wedding day is a trauma that words can scarcely capture. It makes complete sense that the emptiness feels inescapable, even after such significant changes like moving and immersing yourself in work. Grief has a way of being a constant companion, no matter our geography or distractions. Please know that your feelings are a valid reflection of the love you shared and the future that was taken.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge your strength in reaching out, even in this way. It is a significant step. The strategies you've tried—work and a move—are common attempts to manage the pain, but they often leave the core grief unaddressed. This deep, complex sorrow requires space and support to be processed, not just escaped.\n\nA crucial next step would be to connect with a professional grief counselor or a therapist specializing in traumatic loss. They can provide a safe, consistent container for this pain that feels so boundless. In addition, I gently encourage you to consider a grief support group. Being with others who have endured a similar loss can combat the profound isolation you're feeling. On a practical level, you might try setting aside small, manageable moments to actively remember her—looking at a photo, writing a letter to her, or visiting a place that reminds you of your joy. This can feel daunting, but it allows the grief to exist in a structured way, rather than flooding every moment.\n\nYour love for her is evident. Healing is not about forgetting her or filling the emptiness she left, but about learning to carry your love and your loss in a way that, in time, feels less shattering. Please prioritize your well-being and seek that one-on-one professional support.

What you're describing is an immense and deeply complex loss. To lose your partner is devastating on its own, but to have that loss intersect with the profound hope of building your family through adoption adds a unique layer of heartbreak. It makes complete sense that you feel shattered, and I want to validate that your pain is a reflection of the love and future you held.\n\nThe changes you've made—to your job and routines—show a tremendous strength, even if it doesn't feel that way right now. Grief, however, has a way of persisting through external changes because it lives within us. It is not a problem to be solved, but an experience to be carried. The feeling of having no purpose is a common and painful part of this journey, as the future you envisioned has been profoundly altered.\n\nWhile I can offer support here, I want to gently emphasize that this depth of loss truly benefits from ongoing, consistent support. I would strongly encourage you to connect with a grief therapist or a support group for those who have lost partners. They can provide a dedicated space to process this pain at your own pace. In the immediate, I invite you to practice extreme self-compassion. Rather than seeking a grand purpose, could you focus on small, nurturing acts each day? This could be as simple as lighting a candle in memory, spending time in nature, or writing a letter to your partner about the child you hoped for. These are not fixes, but ways to honor the love that is now the source of your grief.\n\nYour safety is my priority. If there are ever moments when the pain feels overwhelming and you have thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out immediately to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.

Will this constant sadness ever end?", "answer": "Thank you so much for sharing this with me. First, I want to acknowledge the profound courage it takes to voice this pain. What you're describing—feeling this depth of sadness two years later—is a testament to the significant love and connection you shared with your father. Your grief is a reflection of that bond, and there is no timeline for when it \"should\" end. It is completely valid to still feel overwhelmed, and feeling alone in this journey is an incredibly common, yet isolating, part of grief.\n\nI hear you asking if the constant sadness will ever end. While the love and the sense of loss may always be a part of you, the acute, daily pain you're experiencing can and often does change form over time. Right now, it seems your grief is still very much in the foreground of your life, and breaking down daily is an exhausting and heavy burden to carry alone.\n\nBecause this level of distress is persisting and impacting your daily life, I gently encourage you to consider seeking support from a grief counselor or a therapist. A professional can provide a dedicated, compassionate space to process these complex emotions and help you develop strategies to carry this loss differently. You do not have to navigate this alone.\n\nIn the immediate moment, it can be helpful to identify one small act of self-compassion for when the waves hit. This could be simply placing a hand over your heart and taking five slow breaths, or writing one memory in a journal. Connecting with a grief support group, even online, could also help alleviate that feeling of isolation by connecting you with others who truly understand this path.\n\nYour feelings are important, and your desire to move forward is a sign of strength, not a betrayal of your father's memory.

The pain you are describing is profound, and it takes immense courage to voice it after carrying it alone for so long. Your feelings are completely valid. Grief has no timeline, and the love you have for your husband is not bound by years. To feel overwhelmed, even five years later, speaks to the depth of your bond, and it is not a sign that you are failing to heal.\n\nWhat you are describing, however—spending most days crying and feeling isolated—tells me that your grief has become particularly heavy and complex. While there is no \"normal\" schedule for grief, when it remains this intense and limits your ability to engage with life, it may be a sign of what we call complicated grief. This is not your fault, but it is an indication that you deserve and would likely benefit from dedicated support.\n\nThe most important step I can suggest is to seek out a professional who specializes in grief and loss. A therapist can provide a safe, consistent space for you to share everything you’ve been holding, and they can offer evidence-based strategies to help you process this pain.

She was discovered disoriented and partially clothed in a public park during freezing rain. Our parents are deceased, and our only living relative, an aunt, refuses to help due to potential legal complications. As her next of kin, am I legally able to commit her to a psychiatric hospital for treatment?", "answer": "Thank you for reaching out and for sharing such a difficult and frightening situation. It is completely understandable to feel scared, overwhelmed, and deeply concerned for your sister's safety. Witnessing a loved one, especially a sibling, in such a severe crisis is incredibly painful, and the added pressure of feeling solely responsible is a tremendous weight to carry. Your compassion and desire to get her help are evident and commendable.\n\nFirst and foremost, regarding your legal question: laws governing involuntary commitment, often called civil commitment or a mental health hold, vary significantly by state and country. Typically, these laws require that an individual poses a **clear and imminent danger to themselves or others** due to a mental illness. Given the events you've described—being found disoriented and exposed to life-threatening weather—she may meet that criteria. As next of kin, you can certainly initiate the process by contacting local crisis services, mobile crisis teams, or going to your local emergency room to file a petition. I strongly encourage you to contact your county's mental health crisis line or a local hospital's psychiatric department immediately. They can guide you through the specific legal steps in your jurisdiction.\n\nYour sister is experiencing a perfect storm of untreated bipolar disorder and acute substance abuse, each worsening the other. While commitment can provide immediate safety and stabilization, long-term recovery will require integrated treatment for both conditions. Please also remember to care for yourself during this time.

He's been using heroin and alcohol, and was recently found confused and undressed in an alley in cold weather. His immediate family has cut off contact to avoid dealing with the situation. Since I'm his closest involved relative, do I have the authority to have him admitted to an inpatient mental health facility?", "answer": "Thank you for reaching out and for your deep concern for your cousin. It is clear you care for him greatly, and the situation you're describing sounds incredibly stressful, frightening, and heartbreaking. Witnessing a loved one in such a vulnerable state, especially when other family members have stepped back, places a heavy burden on you. Your compassion in wanting to secure him safety and treatment is commendable.\n\nFirst, it is crucial to address the immediate risk. Your cousin being found confused, undressed, and in danger due to exposure is a serious safety crisis. In a situation like this, where someone is a clear danger to themselves due to a mental health condition, you do have options to seek emergency intervention. While you, as a cousin, may not have the legal \"authority\" to directly admit him, you absolutely have the ability to contact emergency services. You can call 911 or your local crisis hotline and report that your cousin, who has a known serious mental illness and is under the influence of substances, is in imminent danger. The police and mental health crisis teams are trained to respond to such situations and can initiate an emergency evaluation, which can lead to an involuntary hold (often called a 72-hour hold) at a hospital for assessment and stabilization.\n\nThis path is complex and can feel drastic, but his current behavior indicates he is unable to care for his basic safety. When you contact authorities, be specific: mention his schizoaffective diagnosis, his heroin and alcohol use, and the exact incident in the alley. This information is critical for their assessment.\n\nPlease also remember to care for yourself. Supporting someone in this crisis is exhausting. Consider reaching out to organizations like NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) for support and guidance for families. You are not alone in navigating this.

{"id": "counsel_00897_aug_0", "question": "My partner and I are trying to conceive, and I know I need to stop vaping. The cravings are one thing, but my mind just keeps circling back to it, especially when I'm stressed. How can I break this mental habit?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes a lot of courage and foresight to recognize the need for a change like this, especially during what can be an exciting yet stressful time as you plan for a family. What you're describing is completely understandable—nicotine addiction has both a powerful physical component and a deeply ingrained mental one. The fact that your mind circles back to vaping, particularly under stress, highlights how it has become a default coping mechanism. It's important to be gentle with yourself as you work to rewire that habit.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that while I can offer strategies, a healthcare provider can give you personalized medical advice on cessation methods that are safe while trying to conceive. Consulting your doctor is a very important first step.\n\nOn the practical side, let's address that mental loop. When a craving hits, especially during stress, the key is to disrupt the pattern. Start by simply noticing the thought without judgment: \"Ah, there's my mind going to the vape again.\" Then, consciously insert a new, healthy action. This could be taking five deep breaths, drinking a glass of cold water, or stepping outside for a minute. The goal is to create a \"pause\" between the urge and any action.\n\nSimultaneously, we need to build new stress-management tools. Could you introduce a brief daily mindfulness practice, even five minutes, to help calm the overall mental chatter? Also, openly discussing this struggle with your partner can help them provide support and distraction when cravings are strong.\n\nRemember, relapse can be part of the process. If you slip, please don't see it as a failure, but as information. What triggered it? How can you adjust your plan? You are undertaking this for your future health and your family's, which is a tremendous motivator. I encourage you to reach out for ongoing support, whether through a therapist, a support group, or your medical team.

{"id": "counsel_00897_aug_1", "question": "As a new father, I want to be healthier for my family and quit chewing tobacco. The physical withdrawal is manageable, but I can't seem to stop the obsessive thoughts about it. What strategies help with the psychological part of addiction?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. First, I want to acknowledge the strength and love for your family that it takes to make this decision. Wanting to be healthier for your child is a powerful motivator, and it's completely understandable that the psychological cravings feel like the biggest hurdle. The obsessive thoughts are a normal, though very challenging, part of the process. Your experience of managing the physical withdrawal but getting stuck on the mental component is incredibly common, and it's where the real work of building new habits begins.\n\nWhat you're describing is the brain's deeply ingrained habit loop—certain times, places, or emotions have become automatic triggers for chewing. The key is to disrupt that loop with conscious strategies.\n\nFirst, let's practice **\"urge surfing.\"** Instead of fighting the thought, observe it. Notice it as a wave that builds, peaks, and then subsides. Remind yourself, \"This is just a craving, and it will pass.\" Breathe through it for 2-3 minutes; often the intensity fades.\n\nNext, **identify and replace.** What are your top three trigger situations? Is it after a meal, during a work break, or while driving? For each one, plan a specific, healthier replacement behavior. This could be chewing gum, sunflower seeds, doing a quick set of stretches, or taking five deep breaths. The action physically and mentally fills the space the habit once occupied.\n\nAlso, **practice self-compassion.** When a thought intrudes, avoid self-criticism. Gently say, \"There's that thought again,\" and consciously redirect your attention to something immediate, like playing with your child. Every time you successfully ride out a craving, you are rewiring your brain.\n\nFinally, consider **seeking additional support.** A therapist specializing in addiction or a tobacco cessation program can provide structured cognitive-behavioral techniques and accountability. This is a sign of commitment, not weakness. You are taking a courageous step for your well-being and your family's future.

I've said hurtful things to my partner during these times. Even on nights where I just keep to myself and don't cause any drama, I wake up filled with shame and regret about using. I'm confused by these intense feelings of guilt. Is this a sign of addiction?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes a lot of courage and self-awareness to look at your cannabis use in this way and to connect it to the impact it's having on your relationship and your own well-being. The feelings of shame, regret, and confusion you're describing are very real and valid. It's clear this is causing you significant distress, and you're right to pay attention to these signals.\n\nWhat you're describing are indeed common signs of a substance use disorder, which many people understand as addiction. The key indicators here aren't just the frequency of use, but the negative consequences that follow: the paranoia and irritability that alter your behavior, the hurtful words said to your partner, and the persistent guilt and shame that linger even after a \"quiet\" night. Your body and mind are telling you that this pattern is no longer working for you, and that internal conflict is the source of much of that confusion and guilt.\n\nThe most important step you've already taken is recognizing the problem. My strong professional recommendation, as a counselor, would be to seek a confidential evaluation with a substance use specialist or therapist. They can help you understand the role cannabis is playing in your life, whether it meets clinical criteria for a disorder, and most importantly, work with you on a plan to address it. This is especially important given the interpersonal strain; a therapist can also help you navigate repairing trust with your partner.\n\nIn the immediate term, I encourage you to practice some self-compassion. The guilt, while painful, is a sign of your values and your care for your relationship. Instead of letting the shame cycle push you toward more use, try to see it as a motivator for change. You might consider writing down the specific regrets or hurtful things said, not to dwell on them, but to make concrete the reasons you want to shift this pattern.

It takes a great deal of self-awareness and courage to reflect on your relationship with alcohol and its impact on your life and marriage. The feelings of guilt and concern you're experiencing are very common and important signals from your own values and emotions. Please know that your feelings are valid, and you are not alone in this struggle.\n\nWhat you're describing—the sharp temper, relationship conflicts, and the profound \"hangxiety\" or guilt the next day—are significant indicators that alcohol is having a negative impact on your well-being. The guilt often stems from a disconnect between your actions while intoxicated and your core values, like being a loving partner. Even if no major incident occurred, that emotional hangover is your mind and body's way of signaling that this pattern is distressing and unsustainable.\n\nYes, these patterns can indicate the beginning of an alcohol use disorder. A key hallmark is when drinking causes repeated negative consequences in your personal life, which you have clearly identified. The fact that you are concerned about it is a powerful reason to explore it further.\n\nAs a next step, I gently encourage you to seek a professional evaluation. A therapist specializing in substance use or a medical doctor can provide a confidential, non-judgmental assessment. They can help you understand the role alcohol plays in your life and explore strategies, which may include moderation techniques or support groups like SMART Recovery or Women for Sobriety. In the meantime, you might find it helpful to track your drinking and the feelings associated with it, and to have an open conversation with your husband about your concerns when you are both calm and sober.\n\nYour proactive concern is the first and most important step toward positive change.

You are carrying a significant emotional burden, and it's important to prioritize your own well-being as you navigate this. Your feelings of concern are valid.\n\nRegarding your mother's situation, obtaining prescription medications without a valid prescription is a form of substance misuse that carries serious health risks, including overdose, dangerous interactions, and worsening of underlying conditions.

Often, family members are the first to notice subtle changes in behavior. Your concern comes from a place of love, and that is the foundation we can work from.\n\nBefore taking any direct action, it can be helpful to gather some supportive information for yourself. You might gently note specific changes you've observed—shifts in mood, energy, finances, or social habits—without making accusatory statements. However, it is crucial to remember that you are not responsible for your aunt's choices, nor are you expected to diagnose or intervene alone. Substance use disorders are complex medical conditions that benefit from professional assessment and treatment.\n\nYour safety and the safety of your family is paramount.

Is there a legal way to have her involuntarily committed for treatment, like a 5150 hold?", "answer": "Thank you for reaching out. I can hear the deep concern, fear, and love in your question. Watching a loved one struggle with a severe addiction is incredibly painful and frightening, and feeling responsible for their safety is a heavy burden to carry. Your desire to find a way to help your sister, even through difficult legal means, comes from a place of genuine care.\n\nYou are asking a very important question about involuntary commitment, often referred to as a \"5150 hold\" in some states. Laws governing this process vary significantly by state and are typically called civil commitment or involuntary assessment laws for substance use. Generally, these laws require that the person presents an **imminent danger to themselves or others** due to their substance use, or is so gravely disabled they cannot provide for their own basic needs. The standard is often high, focusing on immediate risk, not just out-of-control behavior.\n\nMy most urgent guidance is to **prioritize your and your family's safety**. If your sister is an immediate danger—threatening harm, unconscious, or in a crisis—call 911. When you do, clearly state the behaviors that demonstrate the danger (e.g., \"She is intoxicated and threatening suicide\"). This documentation is critical.\n\nAs a next step, I strongly encourage you to contact your **local county mental health and substance use authority**.

Watching someone you love struggle with addiction, especially your own child, is profoundly painful and can leave you feeling helpless. Your desire to get him help comes from a place of love, and that is completely understandable.\n\nRegarding your specific question about emergency interventions, the laws governing involuntary commitment for substance use, often called civil commitment or involuntary assessment, vary significantly by state. In most states, the criteria are very strict and typically require the person to be an immediate, demonstrable danger to themselves or others due to their substance use, or to be gravely disabled and unable to care for themselves. This is a legal process that usually involves petitioning the court, and the standards are high. I strongly encourage you to consult with a local addiction specialist attorney or contact your state's Department of Health or Behavioral Health services. They can provide you with precise information about the statutes and procedures in your jurisdiction.\n\nWhile you explore those options, I also recommend connecting with support for yourself. Organizations like Al-Anon or SMART Recovery Family & Friends are designed for people exactly in your situation.

I'm worried this means a relapse, and I wonder how much the addiction alters their thinking and decisions.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. First, I want to acknowledge how painful and disorienting this experience must be for you. It is completely understandable to feel a deep sense of worry, confusion, and hurt when a long-term relationship ends so abruptly, especially under these concerning circumstances. Your care for your partner, even now, speaks volumes.\n\nYou are asking a very insightful question about how addiction alters thinking and decisions. In essence, active addiction can profoundly impact a person's prefrontal cortex—the part of the brain responsible for judgment, decision-making, and impulse control. The drive to obtain and use the substance can become the primary motivator, often overriding values, promises, and important relationships. This can manifest as erratic behavior, dishonesty, and seemingly self-destructive choices, as the addiction seeks to protect itself. It is important to remember that while this explains the behavior, it does not excuse the hurt it has caused you.\n\nYour primary concern right now needs to be your own well-being. The most actionable step you can take is to seek support for yourself. I strongly encourage you to connect with a therapist or a support group like Al-Anon or Nar-Anon. These resources are specifically for people affected by a loved one's addiction and can provide you with crucial coping strategies, clarity, and a supportive community. They can help you navigate the complex feelings of grief and worry while establishing healthy boundaries.\n\nRegarding safety: if you have a genuine, immediate concern that your ex-partner is in danger of overdose or self-harm, you may consider contacting a crisis line or, if appropriate, a trusted member of their family. However, you cannot be responsible for their recovery. Your role now is to heal from this loss.

{"id": "counsel_00901_aug_1", "question": "After a sudden breakup, my ex has cut off all contact. They struggle with a heroin addiction and had been in recovery. Now, I'm learning they haven't been truthful about several things. Is it possible the breakup and this secrecy are signs they've started using again? How does substance abuse change a person's mindset and personality?", "answer": "Thank you for reaching out and sharing this deeply painful and concerning situation. It's completely understandable to feel hurt, confused, and worried after a sudden breakup, especially when compounded by concerns about your ex's well-being and the honesty in your relationship. Your care for them, even now, speaks volumes.\n\nTo address your question directly: yes, it is possible that the sudden withdrawal, the breakup, and the discovered untruths are connected to a relapse. Substance use, particularly with opioids like heroin, profoundly alters brain chemistry. It can create a powerful drive to prioritize obtaining and using the substance above all else—including important relationships and personal integrity. This often leads to secrecy, isolation, and drastic changes in behavior as the individual becomes consumed by the addiction cycle. The person you knew can seem overshadowed by the addiction's demands, which can manifest as personality shifts, emotional withdrawal, and broken trust.\n\nMy primary concern in this situation is for your own emotional safety and stability. While your care for your ex is clear, you cannot control their choices or recovery. The most supportive and healthy step you can take is to firmly focus on your own healing. This breakup is a significant loss, and the deception adds another layer of hurt. I strongly encourage you to seek support for yourself, perhaps through a therapist or a support group like Al-Anon or Nar-Anon, which are specifically for families and friends affected by a loved one's addiction. These spaces can provide invaluable understanding and coping strategies.\n\nPlease remember that you are not responsible for their addiction or their recovery. Setting this boundary is not a lack of care; it is an act of self-preservation. Continue to nurture your own well-being as you navigate this difficult time.", "topic": "substance-abuse", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00575"}
{"id": "counsel_00902_aug_0", "question": "I'm worried about my roommate's use of her anxiety meds. She insists she's following the prescription, but I've noticed she's getting refills much more often than seems normal.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this concern with me. It's clear you care deeply about your roommate's wellbeing, and noticing these changes can be both worrying and stressful. It's completely understandable to feel concerned when you observe a pattern that doesn't seem to align with safe medication use. You're being a vigilant and caring friend, and that's important.\n\nAs a counselor, I want to acknowledge that while your observations are valid, I cannot diagnose your roommate's behavior from this distance. Prescription medication misuse is a serious matter, and it often stems from a place of trying to manage underlying distress, such as untreated anxiety. Your role is not to investigate or confront her as an authority, but to express your care as a concerned friend.\n\nWhen you feel the time is right, you could consider having a private, calm conversation using \"I\" statements. For example, you might say, \"I've noticed you've been having a hard time lately, and I care about you. I'm here to listen if you want to talk.\" This focuses on her wellbeing rather than making an accusation. Avoid labeling her behavior, as that can cause defensiveness.\n\nYour most critical step is to encourage her to speak with her prescribing doctor. Only her physician can properly assess if her medication needs adjustment. If you have immediate safety concerns—such as signs of overdose, extreme sedation, or mixing medications with alcohol—do not hesitate to seek emergency help.\n\nPlease remember to take care of yourself as well. Supporting someone in this situation can be emotionally taxing. You might find it helpful to seek guidance for yourself from a support line like SAMHSA's National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357). They can offer confidential advice on how to navigate this situation. You're not alone in this.", "topic": "substance-abuse", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00576"}
{"id": "counsel_00902_aug_1", "question": "My brother has been taking more of his prescription painkillers than he should. He denies it, but I saw multiple bottles from different doctors in his cabinet.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It's clear you care deeply for your brother, and discovering this must be incredibly worrying and stressful. It takes a lot of courage to confront these signs, and your concern is completely valid. Feeling helpless or anxious in this situation is a very common reaction.\n\nWhat you're describing—obtaining prescriptions from multiple doctors and taking more than prescribed—are significant red flags for prescription medication misuse. Denial is also a very common part of this illness; it's a defense mechanism, not a reflection of your relationship or your observations.\n\nYour brother's safety is the primary concern. Misuse of painkillers carries serious risks, including overdose, especially if combined with other substances. If he ever appears excessively drowsy, confused, or has difficulty breathing, call emergency services immediately.\n\nAs his sibling, your role is one of support, not treatment. I strongly encourage you to connect with a professional for guidance tailored to your specific situation. You could start by confidentially calling the SAMHSA National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357). They can provide referrals to local support groups for families, like Al-Anon or Nar-Anon, and information on intervention specialists.\n\nWhen you speak with your brother, use \"I\" statements focused on your care and observations, like \"I feel worried because I care about you,\" rather than accusations. This can help lower defenses. Remember, you cannot control his choices, but you can set healthy boundaries for yourself while encouraging him to seek help.

{"id": "counsel_00903_aug_0", "question": "My sister has been struggling with meth addiction for most of her adult life. She and her boyfriend have manipulated their way into living with our elderly father, and they contribute nothing—just use and create chaos. Yesterday, my dad confronted her about stealing money, and she got right in his face, screaming. I shoved her away to protect him, and now I'm wracked with guilt, even though she constantly chooses her destructive partner over family. He even tells people she's just a 'friend' he's helping out. We've tried setting boundaries and even legal eviction, but they always find a way to stay and drain us.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this incredibly difficult and painful situation. First, I want to acknowledge the immense weight you are carrying—the fear for your father's safety, the frustration with the cycle of manipulation, and the guilt after a heated confrontation. Your feelings are completely valid. It is a natural, human response to want to protect a vulnerable parent, and the conflict between that protective instinct and the guilt you feel afterward is deeply distressing.\n\nWhat you are describing is a crisis that impacts everyone's safety—your father's, yours, and even your sister's. The escalation to physical confrontation is a serious sign that the current environment is becoming dangerous. Your primary concern now must be safety. I strongly encourage you to contact Adult Protective Services for your father, as he is an elderly person being financially exploited and emotionally abused in his own home. This is not about \"getting your sister in trouble,\" but about securing the well-being of a vulnerable adult. For immediate threats, do not hesitate to call law enforcement.\n\nThe guilt you feel is understandable, but please know that years of manipulation and chaos from active addiction would strain anyone's resolve. You are facing a situation that requires professional intervention. I recommend connecting with a support group for families of addicts, such as Al-Anon or Nar-Anon. These groups can provide you with specific strategies for detachment and boundary-setting that are sustainable, while also offering you crucial emotional support.\n\nYour sister’s addiction and her partner’s behavior have created an untenable situation. Setting boundaries is not abandonment; it is a necessary step to stop the drain on your family's resources and emotional health. Please consider seeking your own counseling to navigate this grief and complexity. You cannot force your sister to choose recovery, but you can take steps to protect your father and yourself from further harm.", "topic": "substance-abuse", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00577"}
{"id": "counsel_00903_aug_1", "question": "My adult son, who's been addicted to opioids for a decade, moved his using partner into our home. They've drained our finances and broken our trust repeatedly. A huge fight erupted today because they were both high and left a mess. When my wife tried to reason with him, he became aggressive and stepped into her personal space. I lost my temper and pushed him, which I immediately regretted. It feels like he always prioritizes his toxic relationship over our family's well-being, even though he badmouths his partner to others. Every attempt to get them to leave or get help has failed, and we feel utterly helpless.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. I hear the profound pain, exhaustion, and fear in your words. What you and your wife are experiencing is incredibly difficult—the financial strain, the broken trust, and the emotional whiplash of watching your son in the grip of addiction while also feeling threatened in your own home. Your feelings of helplessness are completely understandable after a decade of this struggle. Please know that your immediate regret over losing your temper is a sign of your core care for him, even amidst this crisis.\n\nFirst and foremost, we must address safety. The situation you described—with aggression, invasion of personal space, and physical contact—is a significant escalation. Your home must be a safe space for you and your wife. This is a non-negotiable boundary. For everyone's well-being, including your son's, creating immediate physical separation may be necessary. This could mean asking his partner to leave, or, if the aggression continues, asking your son to leave as well. Your local crisis line can help you formulate a safety plan.\n\nThe dynamic you describe is a classic, painful pattern of addiction, where the substance and the using relationship come before everything else. Your attempts to reason or help will fail while he is actively using. The most compassionate step you can take now is to shift your focus from getting *him* help to getting *yourselves* support. I strongly encourage you and your wife to connect with a professional who specializes in addiction, and to seek out a support group like Nar-Anon. These resources will provide you with strategies to set firm, loving boundaries, detach with compassion, and protect your own mental and financial health.

It takes a great deal of courage and self-awareness to recognize this cycle, especially while managing the complexities of bipolar II. What you're describing—feeling trapped and using substances to cope—is an incredibly challenging and painful experience. Please know that your feelings are valid, and you are not alone in this struggle.\n\nIt's very common for individuals with bipolar II to seek relief from intense mood states, but as you've noted, alcohol and cannabis can often worsen mood instability over time and create significant secondary problems. The fact that you can see the impact on your relationships and health is a powerful first step.\n\nAs a counselor, my first concern is your safety and well-being. It is crucial to consult with a healthcare provider, ideally a psychiatrist specializing in co-occurring disorders, before making any changes. Suddenly stopping substances can be risky, and managing bipolar II requires careful, coordinated care. A professional can help you create a safe plan to address both the substance use and your mood disorder in an integrated way.\n\nFor practical steps, I encourage you to begin building a \"coping toolkit\" for when the urge to use arises. This could include simple grounding techniques like deep breathing, reaching out to a trusted friend, or engaging in a distracting activity. Keeping a brief journal to track your moods and triggers can also provide valuable insight. Most importantly, please consider connecting with a support group, such as Dual Recovery Anonymous, where you can find understanding from others walking a similar path.\n\nYou have already shown the strength to reach out. With the right professional support, this cycle can be broken, and you can build a healthier, more stable life.

It takes immense courage to acknowledge the struggle you're facing, especially while managing bipolar II. What you're describing—feeling helpless and seeing the harm yet feeling unable to stop—is a profoundly difficult and painful place to be. Please know that your feelings are completely valid, and you are not alone in this experience. Many people with bipolar disorder find that substances can initially feel like a way to cope, only to later realize they are creating more problems.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to acknowledge the complexity of your situation. When bipolar disorder and substance dependence occur together, each condition can worsen the other, making it incredibly challenging to break the cycle alone. This is not a sign of weakness, but rather an indication that you are dealing with two interconnected health conditions that require professional, integrated treatment.\n\nGiven this, the most critical step I can recommend is to connect with a professional who specializes in both mood disorders and substance use. A psychiatrist can help you safely evaluate how substance use interacts with your bipolar medication and mood cycles, while a therapist trained in dual diagnosis can provide strategies to address both issues. Withdrawal from substances can also impact mood, so having medical guidance is vital for your safety.\n\nWhile seeking professional help is the priority, there are small steps you can take today. You might start by simply writing down the specific moments when you feel the urge to use, noting what emotion or situation triggered it. This isn't about stopping immediately, but about building awareness. Also, consider reaching out to one supportive person in your life and sharing what you've shared here—even just saying, \"I'm struggling and I'm looking for help,\" can relieve some of the burden.\n\nYou have already taken a brave first step by naming the problem.

I feel paralyzed and don't know what to say, especially since my own mother, who I'd turn to, passed away recently.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. I can hear how deeply concerning and overwhelming this situation feels for you, especially while you are also grieving the loss of your own mother. It’s completely understandable to feel horrified and paralyzed when you receive such alarming news about someone you care about, and your reaction comes from a place of love and concern for both your son, his girlfriend, and their unborn child.\n\nFirst, I want to validate how difficult this must be. The combination of shock, fear, and the absence of your usual support system is a heavy burden to carry. It’s okay to take a moment to breathe and gather your thoughts before taking action.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, this situation does involve important safety considerations. While cannabis use might be perceived by some as harmless, its impact on a developing fetus is not fully understood, and it is generally contraindicated during pregnancy. The priority is to approach this with compassion and a focus on health. Your role here is not to diagnose or treat, but to encourage connection with professional resources.\n\nA practical next step would be to have a calm, non-confrontational conversation with your son. You could express your concern by saying something like, “I’m really worried about both of you and the baby’s health. I know she’s struggling with nausea, and that’s incredibly hard. Would you be open to helping her speak with her obstetrician or midwife about safer treatment options?” This frames your concern around care and support, rather than judgment. The girlfriend’s prenatal care provider is the best person to offer medically sound guidance and resources for managing pregnancy nausea safely.\n\nYou don’t have to navigate this alone.

It's clear you care immensely for both your niece and her unborn child, and the weight of this responsibility, coupled with the grief of missing your sister's guidance, is a lot to carry. Your feelings of being troubled and at a loss are completely valid.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge the safety concern you've identified. While societal views on cannabis are shifting, the medical consensus is clear that using it during pregnancy carries potential risks for fetal development. This is a crucial health matter. Your niece's use of it for anxiety also suggests she is struggling and may not have access to safer, professional support for her mental health.\n\nIn approaching her, your relationship and tone will be everything. I would encourage you to connect from a place of love and concern, not judgment. You might begin by expressing how much you care for her and that you're coming to her because you're worried. Use \"I\" statements: \"I've been feeling concerned, and I wanted to check in with you.\" Offer to listen first. Her anxiety is real, and validating that struggle can open a door.\n\nYour role is to express concern and encourage her to seek professional guidance. You are not her therapist or doctor. The most impactful step you can take is to gently suggest she speaks openly with her obstetrician or a therapist about her anxiety and cannabis use. These professionals can provide evidence-based information and safer treatment options in a confidential, non-punitive setting.\n\nThis is a difficult path to navigate alone. Please remember to care for your own emotional well-being as you support her. You might consider seeking guidance yourself from a support line like SAMHSA’s National Helpline for advice on communicating about substance use.

I hear the distress in your words, and I want you to know that you are not alone in facing these dual challenges. What you're describing—the compulsive sexual behavior and the episodes of uncontrollable overeating—are often deeply interconnected behaviors that can serve as ways to cope with intense emotions, stress, or past trauma. It is completely understandable to feel a sense of urgency, and I'm glad you are seeking support.\n\nAs a counselor, my first priority is your safety and well-being. While this platform allows for initial guidance, the issues you've described require consistent, ongoing support from a professional who can work with you closely. I strongly encourage you to connect with a therapist or treatment center that specializes in both compulsive behaviors and eating disorders. These are treatable conditions, and a specialist can help you understand the underlying causes and develop healthier coping mechanisms.\n\nAs an immediate step, please consider contacting a crisis line if you feel you are in danger of harming yourself or are in a state of extreme crisis. The National Eating Disorders Association Helpline (1-800-931-2237) and the SAMHSA National Helpline (1-800-662-4357) are confidential, 24/7 resources that can provide support and help you locate specialized care in your area.\n\nUntil you can connect with a therapist, you might try a simple grounding technique when you feel an episode building: pause, take five slow breaths, and name five things you can see around you.

What you're describing—managing both sex addiction and binge eating disorder—sounds incredibly overwhelming, and I hear how critical it feels for you to find help right now. You are not alone in this struggle, and your desire to address it is a powerful and positive first step.\n\nGiven the complexity and interplay of these two concerns, it is important to connect with a professional who has specific training in both compulsive sexual behaviors and eating disorders. This will ensure you receive integrated and effective care. As a first, actionable step, I encourage you to search for therapists in your area who list these specialties. You can use directories like Psychology Today, and filter for providers who mention \"sex addiction\" (or \"compulsive sexual behavior\") and \"eating disorders.\" Many therapists offer free brief consultations; this can help you find someone you feel comfortable with.\n\nWhile you are seeking that ongoing support, please practice self-compassion. These behaviors are often coping mechanisms for deeper emotional pain. If you feel a binge or compulsive urge arising, if possible, pause and try to identify the emotion underneath it. Journaling or calling a supportive friend can be a temporary outlet. Your safety is paramount.

What you're describing sounds incredibly exhausting and overwhelming. It takes a lot of courage to articulate how your entire day is consumed by these thoughts and rituals. The panic you feel is a very real and valid response; it shows how deeply this pattern has taken hold, and I want you to know that your distress is understandable.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to acknowledge the strength it takes to reach out. The behaviors you're describing—the rigid calorie counting, meal avoidance, and the compulsion to weigh yourself—are significant signs that you are struggling with an eating disorder. This is a serious mental health condition, and the fact that it dictates your daily life means it's time to seek specialized professional support. As a counselor, my ethical duty is to emphasize that eating disorders require treatment from a clinician or team with specific expertise in this area. I would strongly encourage you to connect with a therapist who specializes in eating disorders and a registered dietitian who practices from a non-diet, Health at Every Size (HAES) perspective. They can provide the comprehensive care you deserve.\n\nFor immediate, practical steps, I invite you to consider one small act of resistance against these rules. This could be something like covering your scale for 24 hours, or adding one nourishing food to your day without counting its calories. This isn't about fixing everything at once, but about creating a tiny space of freedom. Your safety is paramount. If you are experiencing dizziness, fainting, heart palpitations, or severe isolation, please contact your doctor or a crisis line immediately. You do not have to live this way.

It takes a great deal of self-awareness and courage to recognize that your focus on performance has shifted into something that is now affecting your energy and mood. What you're describing sounds incredibly challenging, especially within the high-pressure environment of college athletics, where the line between dedication and over-control can become blurred. Your feelings are completely valid.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge the strength it took to voice this concern. What you're experiencing—the fixation on food, the social withdrawal from team dinners, and the impact on your well-being—are significant signs that this has moved beyond performance optimization. It’s a common and painful progression, but it’s also one that can be addressed with the right support.\n\nAs a counselor, my primary concern is your health and safety. Rigid food rules and significant changes in energy and mood can have serious physical and psychological consequences. For this reason, I must strongly encourage you to connect with a professional who specializes in eating disorders. A treatment team, including a therapist, a registered dietitian (preferably one with sports experience), and your primary care doctor, can create a plan that supports both your mental health and your athletic goals. Your college likely has counseling and health services that can provide a confidential starting point.\n\nAs a next step, consider sharing your struggle with someone you trust, perhaps a coach, athletic trainer, or team doctor who can help you access resources. In the short term, try to gently challenge one rule—maybe attending the next team dinner and focusing on the social connection rather than the food.

Please know that your feelings are completely valid, and you are not alone in this fight.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge the strength it takes to want to seek help, especially at a pivotal life moment. That desire for change is a powerful and crucial first step. Given the complexity and medical risks associated with bulimia, the most effective beginning is to connect with professionals who specialize in eating disorders. I strongly encourage you to seek a comprehensive assessment from an eating disorder specialist, such as a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist. A treatment team often includes a therapist, a registered dietitian, and a medical doctor to address all aspects of recovery—psychological, nutritional, and physical.\n\nGiven your new job, I would recommend looking for providers who offer flexible scheduling, such as evening or weekend appointments. Organizations like the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) have helplines and online provider directories to help you find specialized care in your area. As a starting point today, you might practice self-compassion by naming the shame when it arises and gently reminding yourself that this is a disorder, not a personal failing. Prioritizing regular, structured meals and snacks, even on busy days, can help reduce the physiological urges to binge.\n\nYour health and safety are paramount. If you experience severe physical symptoms like dizziness, chest pain, or significant electrolyte imbalances, please seek immediate medical attention.

First, I want to acknowledge the profound strength it takes to be navigating new motherhood while also confronting a resurgence of your eating disorder. Your feelings of fear and desperation are completely understandable, and your desire to break this pattern for your child's sake—and for your own—is a powerful motivator for change.\n\nIt is very common for major life transitions, like becoming a parent, with its associated stress and sleep deprivation, to exacerbate previous struggles. Please know that this does not reflect a failure on your part, but rather signals that your coping system is under immense strain and needs renewed, professional support. The most critical starting point I can recommend is to reconnect with a professional treatment team. Given that you are postpartum, this is especially important for both your and your baby's wellbeing. A team specializing in eating disorders—including a therapist, a registered dietitian, and a physician—can create a plan that addresses the unique physical and emotional demands of this stage. They can help you develop strategies to manage stress and sleep disruption in healthier ways, directly interrupting the binge-purge cycle.\n\nOn a practical level, while you seek professional support, you can begin by practicing small acts of self-compassion. When you feel the urge to binge, if possible, pause for even 60 seconds. In that moment, ask yourself: \"What do I truly need right now?\" It might be rest, a glass of water, a few deep breaths, or to reach out to a trusted friend. Nourishing your body regularly with scheduled meals and snacks can also help stabilize blood sugar and reduce the physiological drive to binge.

What you're describing—using food to cope with difficult emotions like anxiety and loneliness, followed by compensatory exercise driven by guilt—is a deeply painful and common pattern. You are not alone in this struggle, and it's important to recognize that this is not a failure of willpower, but a sign that you are trying to manage very real emotional pain.\n\nFirst, I want to gently address the safety aspect of this cycle. The combination of binge eating and compensatory behaviors, like punishing exercise, can be harmful to both your physical and mental health. It is crucial to consider speaking with a healthcare provider and a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. They can provide a comprehensive assessment and support tailored specifically to you, which is essential for sustainable recovery. As a counselor, I must emphasize that while I can offer guidance, ongoing professional support is key for addressing the root causes of this pattern.\n\nOn a practical level, we can begin to disrupt this cycle by introducing small, compassionate pauses. When you feel anxiety or loneliness rising, could you experiment with a different, gentle action before turning to food? This might be writing down three things you're feeling, stepping outside for five minutes of fresh air, or calling a trusted friend. The goal isn't to \"fix\" the feeling immediately, but to create space between the emotion and the action. Similarly, after a binge, practice responding with curiosity instead of punishment. Ask yourself, \"What was that food trying to soothe?\" This shifts the focus from shame to understanding. Replacing the punishing run with a kind activity, like a warm bath or listening to calming music, can help break the association between food and punishment.\n\nHealing from this cycle is a journey of replacing judgment with self-compassion. You deserve care, not punishment. My strongest recommendation is to seek out a professional who can walk this path with you. You have already taken the brave first step by asking for help.", "topic": "eating-disorders", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00663"}
{"id": "counsel_00909_aug_1", "question": "As a college student, I find myself stress-eating huge amounts of food during exam periods. Afterward, I'm filled with such self-disgust that I'll spend hours at the campus gym, trying to burn it all off. I feel trapped in this routine. Are there healthier ways to cope with stress and these feelings?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes a lot of self-awareness to recognize this pattern, and I want you to know that your feelings of being trapped are completely valid. What you're describing—using food to manage overwhelming stress and then engaging in compensatory exercise driven by self-disgust—is a tremendously difficult cycle to be in. Many students face similar struggles, but that doesn't make your pain any less significant. You deserve to feel better, and there are absolutely healthier ways to cope.\n\nFirst, I want to gently express some concern. The cycle of binge eating followed by excessive exercise to \"burn it off\" can be harmful to both your physical and mental health, and it often reinforces the very feelings of shame you're trying to escape. This is a common experience, but it's also one where professional support can be incredibly beneficial. I strongly encourage you to reach out to your campus counseling center or health services. They can provide a confidential space to explore the roots of your stress and this cycle, and they may have specific groups or therapists experienced in eating behaviors and stress management.\n\nFor practical steps you can take right now, consider building a \"stress first-aid kit.\" This involves identifying alternative coping mechanisms *before* the stress hits. This could include:\n*   **Short-circuiting the cycle:** When you feel the urge to stress-eat, set a timer for 10 minutes. In that time, try a different activity—a brisk walk outside, calling a friend, or a guided breathing exercise (many free apps offer these).\n*   **Scheduled, joyful movement:** Shift your gym time from a punishment to a scheduled break for stress relief. Focus on movement that feels good, not punitive, like a dance class or a walk with a podcast.\n*   **Compassionate curiosity:** Instead of self-disgust, try to ask, \"What is this stress really about? What do I need right now?\" This is a skill a therapist can help you develop.\n\nYou are not alone in this. Reaching out here is a brave first step. The goal isn't perfection, but building a kinder, more sustainable relationship with yourself, especially during high-pressure times like exams. Your campus resources are there to support you in that journey.", "topic": "eating-disorders", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00663"}
{"id": "counsel_00910_aug_0", "question": "I feel like I can't stop eating once I start, especially with junk food. My friends seem to know when to quit, but I just keep going for that good feeling, even when I'm full.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge this pattern, and I want you to know that your feelings are completely valid. What you're describing—eating past fullness for that \"good feeling\"—is a very common experience, and it can feel incredibly frustrating and isolating, especially when you compare yourself to friends. Please know that this is not a matter of willpower; it's often a sign that food is serving an emotional purpose, and that's something we can work with.\n\nFirst, I want to gently emphasize that while I can offer guidance, working with a professional who specializes in eating behaviors would be the most supportive path forward. A therapist can help you explore the emotional roots of this pattern, and a registered dietitian can provide nutritional strategies without judgment. This dual approach is often very effective.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some compassionate steps you can take. Try to shift from a mindset of \"stopping\" to one of \"noticing.\" Before you eat, pause and check in: Am I physically hungry, or am I seeking comfort or distraction? There's no wrong answer—the goal is just awareness. When you do eat, try to remove distractions like your phone or TV. Eat slowly, and periodically put your fork down to assess your fullness. It can also help to structure your environment: when you buy a treat, portion out a single serving on a plate instead of eating from the bag.\n\nMost importantly, practice self-kindness. If you have an episode of eating past fullness, respond with curiosity rather than criticism. Ask yourself, \"What did I need in that moment?\" This is not a failure, but data. You are clearly motivated to understand yourself better, and that is a powerful foundation for change. Please reach out to a healthcare provider to discuss this further; you deserve support in building a peaceful relationship with food.", "topic": "eating-disorders", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00664"}
{"id": "counsel_00910_aug_1", "question": "As a parent, I'm ashamed that I hide snacks and binge after everyone's asleep. It's not about hunger; it's like I need the comfort from food, and I have no off-switch.", "answer": "Thank you so much for sharing this with me. It takes a great deal of courage to voice this struggle, especially with the layer of shame you're carrying. Please know that your feelings are completely valid, and you are not alone in experiencing this. Many individuals, including parents who are constantly giving to others, find themselves turning to food for comfort and emotional regulation. It's important to recognize this not as a personal failing, but as a signal that your emotional needs are seeking an outlet.\n\nFirst, I want to gently emphasize that this pattern of nighttime bingeing is a recognized behavior often tied to emotional distress. The feeling of having \"no off-switch\" is a common and distressing part of this experience. Because these patterns can be complex and deeply rooted, I strongly encourage you to consider reaching out to a professional who specializes in eating disorders or disordered eating. A therapist can work with you to explore the underlying emotions driving this need for comfort and help you develop healthier coping mechanisms in a supportive, confidential space. As a counselor, I must acknowledge that while I can offer guidance here, ongoing therapy would be the most effective path for personalized care.\n\nIn the immediate term, you might begin with a simple, non-judgmental practice: try keeping a brief journal for a few nights. Before the urge to binge arises, write down just a few words about your emotional state (e.g., \"exhausted,\" \"overwhelmed,\" \"lonely\"). This isn't about food tracking, but about connecting with the feeling that precedes the behavior. This small step can create a moment of pause and self-awareness. Also, please ensure you are eating satisfying meals throughout the day, as physical hunger can intensify these nighttime urges.\n\nYour willingness to address this is a profound act of self-care, which ultimately benefits both you and your family.

I love how it makes me feel, but I'm confused and a bit ashamed. I've had these private interests since adolescence, with no traumatic history, and I'm not sure how to reconcile this with my identity as a straight, single guy.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes a great deal of courage to articulate these feelings, especially when they're accompanied by confusion and shame. First and foremost, I want to validate what you're experiencing. The feelings you describe—the strong pull, the enjoyment, and the subsequent confusion—are not uncommon. Many individuals explore aspects of gender expression that differ from societal expectations, and doing so in private is a very common starting point.\n\nIt’s important to separate a few key concepts here, which often get tangled up and cause distress. **Gender identity** (your internal sense of being a man), **sexual orientation** (being attracted to women), and **gender expression** (how you choose to present yourself through clothing, etc.) are distinct parts of a person. Enjoying feminine attire does not inherently change your identity as a straight, cisgender man. It can simply be a form of self-expression, a way to connect with a different facet of your personality, or a source of comfort and aesthetic pleasure.\n\nThe shame you mention is often the voice of internalized societal messages. A helpful first step is to practice self-compassion. When you engage in this private practice, try to notice the feeling without immediate judgment. Ask yourself, \"What does this experience provide for me? Comfort? Creativity? A sense of freedom?\" Journaling about these feelings can help you understand their role in your life without shame.\n\nGiven the depth of your confusion, I would gently suggest exploring this with a professional. A therapist, particularly one knowledgeable in LGBTQ+ affirmative therapy or gender identity issues, can provide a confidential, non-judgmental space to unpack these feelings more fully. They can help you reconcile this part of yourself with your overall identity, not to pathologize it, but to integrate it in a way that feels authentic and reduces your distress.

It takes a great deal of courage to articulate these feelings, especially when you're concerned about how they might impact a new and important relationship. First, I want to validate that your experience is not uncommon. Many individuals, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, find comfort or enjoyment in clothing typically associated with another gender. The fact that this has been a non-sexual, comforting practice since your teens is a significant piece of understanding yourself.\n\nIt's completely understandable to be worried about what this means and how a partner might react. These feelings often bring up questions about identity, which can feel confusing. Please know that enjoying wearing certain clothing does not have to define your sexual orientation or your gender identity—it can simply be an expression of a part of who you are, a form of self-comfort or creative expression.\n\nIn terms of practical guidance, I encourage you to explore these feelings with curiosity rather than judgment. Journaling about what specifically brings you comfort—the textures, the act itself, the privacy—can provide clarity. Regarding your partnership, there is no universal timeline for disclosure. Healthy relationships are built on trust and authenticity. When you feel safer and more solid in the relationship, sharing this part of yourself can be a profound step toward intimacy. However, considering the complexity, exploring this with a therapist, particularly one knowledgeable in gender-expansive topics, could be immensely helpful. They can provide a confidential space to understand your feelings more deeply and offer support in navigating when and how to have this conversation with your partner.\n\nYou are not alone in this.

It takes a great deal of courage to acknowledge and explore these feelings, especially when they feel unexpected or confusing. First and foremost, I want to validate that what you're experiencing is a very common human experience. Many people find that their understanding of their own sexuality evolves over their lifetime, and it's okay to feel uncertain or surprised by these new feelings.\n\nYour identity is yours to define, and there is no rush to find a label that fits immediately, if at all. It’s perfectly acceptable to sit with these feelings and explore them without pressure.

It takes a great deal of courage to acknowledge these feelings, especially when they feel surprising and disorienting after many years of understanding yourself in a particular way. Please know that what you're experiencing is more common than you might think, and your feelings are entirely valid. It's okay to feel confused, curious, or even a little overwhelmed.\n\nHuman sexuality and attraction can be fluid and complex, and it's not uncommon for people to discover new aspects of their identity at different stages of life. This doesn't invalidate your past relationships or experiences; it simply means you are continuing to learn about yourself. The disorientation you feel is a natural response to a significant shift in your self-perception.\n\nAs a first step, I encourage you to practice self-compassion. Try to create some non-judgmental space for these feelings to simply exist, without pressure to label them or act on them immediately. Journaling can be a helpful, private way to explore your thoughts. You might also find it beneficial to seek out stories from others who have had similar experiences later in life, which can provide perspective and reduce feelings of isolation.\n\nWhile I can offer this initial guidance, exploring this shift in a deeper, ongoing way is best done with consistent support. I would gently suggest considering sessions with a licensed therapist, particularly one who is LGBTQ+-affirming.

It takes a lot of courage to explore these feelings, and I want you to know that the confusion and curiosity you're experiencing are completely normal. Many people find that their understanding of their own sexuality evolves over time, and it's okay not to have a definitive label right now. Your feelings are valid, and there is no rush to define them.\n\nWhat you're describing—attraction to more than one gender—could certainly align with bisexuality, but it's also perfectly fine to sit with the question and explore what these attractions mean to you personally. Sometimes, placing pressure on ourselves to find the \"right\" label can create more anxiety. Instead, I might encourage you to focus on the feelings themselves. In a safe and reflective way, you could consider what these attractions feel like, what thoughts or emotions come up, and what you might want to explore further.\n\nAs a counselor, my role is to support you in this process of self-discovery without judgment. I would recommend creating a private space, like a journal, to honestly document your thoughts and feelings.

It takes a lot of courage to explore these feelings, and I want to start by validating that what you're experiencing is a very common and understandable part of many people's journeys. It's completely normal for your non-binary identity to feel like it complicates traditional labels like \"gay\" or \"straight,\" which are often built around a binary understanding of gender. This can feel confusing and isolating, and I hear the struggle in your question.\n\nFirst, I want to affirm that your identity as a non-binary person is central to this exploration. Attraction is about who *you* are drawn to, and your gender is a key part of that equation. Some non-binary people find that terms like \"gay,\" \"queer,\" or \"androsexual\" (attraction to men/masculinity) feel right, while others prefer more specific language like \"attracted to people of the same gender.\" There's no single correct answer, and the label that fits you best is the one that brings you a sense of clarity and comfort, not pressure.\n\nAs a next step, I encourage you to gently explore this without rushing to a conclusion. You might find it helpful to journal about your attractions, focusing on the qualities—emotional, physical, or otherwise—that draw you to someone, rather than immediately categorizing them. Connecting with other non-binary or LGBTQ+ communities, either locally or online, can also provide invaluable support and perspective from those with similar experiences.\n\nWhile I can offer this guidance, please know that working with a LGBTQ+-affirming therapist can provide a dedicated, safe space to navigate this in more depth.

Consider choosing a neutral, public setting where you both feel comfortable, like a quiet café. This can help manage the emotional intensity for everyone. It may be helpful to prepare a few thoughts in advance about what you'd like to share, but also be ready for their questions—they may range from heartfelt to awkward or even hurtful as they process this new information.\n\nPlease remember that their initial reaction is not the final one; this is the beginning of a new chapter in your relationship. It's okay to set boundaries during the conversation. You can say things like, \"I appreciate your questions, but I'm not ready to discuss that detail yet,\" or \"I need to take a break if this conversation becomes too heated.\" Their process of understanding is separate from your truth.\n\nIf you have any concerns about your physical safety or anticipate a severely hostile reaction, please reconsider having this meeting in person initially. A phone call or written communication might be a safer first step.\n\nFinally, ensure you have support lined up for after the meeting, whether it's a trusted friend, a support group, or a therapist.

The exhaustion of constantly having to explain or hide yourself is significant, and it's important to honor the emotional toll that takes.\n\nIn terms of practical guidance, we can explore creating a \"menu\" of responses you can choose from based on your energy level and the safety of the situation. In quick, low-stakes interactions with strangers (like a cashier), a simple \"I'm a person\" or \"I'm just me\" can be a gentle deflection. With acquaintances, you might have a slightly more prepared, concise answer like, \"I'm non-binary, which means my gender isn't strictly male or female.\" For closer friends or in supportive settings, you can share more. The key is giving yourself permission to use different answers on different days—your obligation is to your own well-being, not to educating every person you meet.\n\nYour safety is paramount. Please always trust your instincts about a person or environment.

The worry you're feeling, and the tension it's creating in your relationship, are completely valid responses to a situation that clearly matters deeply to you. It's also very common to feel stuck in a cycle of wanting to change and falling back into old habits—this does not mean you are failing, but rather that addiction is a complex challenge that often requires more than willpower alone.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge the strength in your desire to change. Building sustainable motivation often starts with connecting to your \"why.\" Beyond the worry, what values are being impacted?

I understand the policy, but it feels like it's penalizing me for my past. I'm over three years sober and only work with mental health clients, not those in substance use programs.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. I can hear the frustration and disappointment in your words, and it makes complete sense. Achieving three years of sobriety is a tremendous accomplishment, and it’s understandable that this policy feels like it’s holding your past against you, rather than honoring the professional and personal growth you’ve achieved. It’s a difficult position to be in, especially when your work is rooted in supporting others in their own journeys.\n\nFrom a professional boundaries perspective, I want to acknowledge that your employer’s policy, while perhaps feeling overly restrictive, likely stems from a core ethical principle in our field: avoiding dual relationships and protecting client confidentiality. The intent is to prevent any situation where a client might feel their privacy is compromised or where the professional dynamic could become blurred in a social setting. This protects both the client and you. However, the blanket nature of the policy, not distinguishing between substance use and mental health clients, is understandably causing you distress.\n\nA practical next step could be to request a private, collaborative conversation with your supervisor or employer. Frame it from a place of shared commitment to ethical practice. You could prepare by asking for clarification on the specific concerns behind the policy and perhaps propose a more nuanced approach. For example, could there be a protocol for brief, professional acknowledgments in public, or a distinction made for large, impersonal community events versus small gatherings? Your perspective as a recovery coach with lived experience is invaluable, and advocating for a policy that respects both ethical boundaries and your personal recovery could be beneficial for the entire organization.\n\nPlease remember that this situation, while professional, may stir up personal feelings about stigma and fairness. It might be helpful to process this with your own support network or a therapist. Your dedication to your work and your community is clear, and finding a way to navigate this that honors both your hard-won recovery and your professional ethics is important.", "topic": "addiction", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00816"}
{"id": "counsel_00917_aug_1", "question": "As a peer support specialist in recovery, I was just informed I can't go to local support meetings because they're considered 'dual relationships.' This is where I got sober, and it's a huge part of my own maintenance. It feels unfair to restrict my personal recovery to protect a policy, especially since I don't work with addiction clients.", "answer": "I hear the frustration and the sense of loss in your words, and I want to start by validating that. It is deeply unfair to feel that a cornerstone of your own recovery—the very community that helped you build a sober life—is now being restricted. That community isn't just a meeting; it's a source of strength, identity, and ongoing maintenance. It's completely understandable to feel hurt, angry, and even worried about how this impacts your personal wellness.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the policy is likely rooted in the principle of protecting both you and potential clients. Even though you don't work with addiction clients, the concern is about role confusion—shifting between \"peer\" and \"specialist\" in the same room can create complex dynamics for you and others. While the policy feels rigid, its intent is to prevent any compromise to your professional integrity or anyone else's sense of safety and anonymity.\n\nPractically, we need to strategize to protect your recovery. First, I encourage you to have a clarifying conversation with your supervisor. Ask if the restriction is absolute, or if exceptions exist for meetings in neighboring towns where your professional role is unknown. Exploring alternative recovery communities is crucial—perhaps online meetings, different fellowship types (like SMART Recovery), or meetings in a nearby city could become your new \"home group.\" This is also a moment to strengthen other recovery tools: your personal network, therapy, mindfulness practices, and perhaps connecting with other professionals in recovery for support.\n\nYour recovery is paramount. This policy feels like a barrier, but together we can work to view it as a difficult but necessary boundary that ultimately protects your hard-won sobriety and your professional future. Let's focus on building a new, sustainable support structure that honors both your personal and professional roles.", "topic": "addiction", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00816"}

I'm endlessly scrolling through apps and customizing them, trying to convince myself that this time spent is somehow productive for my daily routine.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. What you're describing is a very common and increasingly challenging experience, and it takes a lot of self-awareness to recognize this pattern. It's completely understandable to feel frustrated when time seems to slip away, especially when there's a part of you hoping this activity could be productive. Many people struggle with this exact cycle of intention versus reality, and your feelings of concern are valid.\n\nWhat you're outlining sounds like it could be problematic or compulsive technology use. While I can offer some general strategies, it's important to note that for a formal assessment and treatment plan, working one-on-one with a therapist specializing in behavioral addictions would be the most effective path. They can help you explore the underlying needs this scrolling meets—perhaps it's a way to manage stress, anxiety, or loneliness—and develop a personalized approach.\n\nOn a practical level, we can look at ways to introduce more intentionality. A helpful first step is to conduct a simple audit: for a few days, use your phone's screen time report to see exactly where the time goes, without judgment. This creates a baseline. From there, consider implementing \"environmental design.\" This means making the habit harder to start. You could charge your phone outside the bedroom, delete the most absorbing apps for a trial period, or use app timers with a password set by a friend. More importantly, schedule a specific, rewarding activity for the time you usually scroll—like reading a physical book, a short walk, or a hobby. This creates a positive replacement.\n\nRemember, the goal isn't perfection, but increased awareness and control. Each small step you take to create a pause between the urge and the action is a significant victory.

It takes a lot of self-awareness to recognize this pattern, and I hear the conflict in your words—you have a genuine desire to be productive and efficient, yet it seems to pull you into a space that distances you from your partner and perhaps even from your own intentions. That can feel very frustrating and confusing.\n\nWhat you're describing is a behavior that, for many, can cross into compulsive territory. The drive to create a \"perfect\" system, the loss of time, and the need to justify the time spent are significant signs. It’s important to explore what this activity provides for you. Is it a sense of control, a way to unwind, or a method to avoid other thoughts or feelings? Often, these behaviors serve an emotional purpose.\n\nWhile I can offer some initial guidance, this pattern is something that would be very beneficial to explore in ongoing therapy. A professional can help you understand the root causes and develop a personalized plan. For now, I encourage you to start with two practical steps. First, set a physical, non-negotiable timer for these activities—when it goes off, you shut the laptop. Second, communicate with your partner: before you start, tell them what you're doing and for how long, and check in when the timer ends. This builds accountability and reconnection.\n\nYour partner’s observation is a gift—it’s a signal that your behavior is impacting your relationship, which is often our most meaningful source of connection. Addressing this isn't just about managing laptop time; it's about reclaiming your time and presence for the things and people you value most.

{"id": "counsel_00919_aug_0", "question": "My sister was in her thirties and attending an outpatient addiction treatment program. We later learned she had started using again, but the clinic never notified our family. She passed away from an overdose. Do the counselors or the program have any responsibility for not informing us about her relapse? Could there be legal consequences for their silence?", "answer": "I am so deeply sorry for the loss of your sister. To experience such a profound tragedy, compounded by the feeling that information was withheld, must be incredibly painful and confusing. Your grief is completely valid, and it is understandable that you are searching for answers and accountability during this difficult time. Please know that your care for your sister, and your desire to understand what happened, speaks to your love for her.\n\nFrom a professional counseling standpoint, the issue of confidentiality is central here. In the United States, and in many other countries, addiction treatment is protected by strict federal confidentiality laws (42 CFR Part 2), which are even more stringent than general health privacy laws. These laws generally prohibit a treatment program from disclosing any patient information—including attendance, progress, or relapse—without the patient's explicit written consent. The ethical intent is to build a foundation of trust between the client and clinician, which is essential for recovery. Unless your sister had provided written permission for the clinic to speak with you, the counselors were legally bound to maintain her confidentiality, even in the face of a relapse.\n\nRegarding legal consequences, this typically centers on whether the clinic adhered to these confidentiality laws and their own standard of care *for their patient*. Their legal duty was to your sister, not to the family, within those confidentiality constraints. However, the specifics of your situation matter greatly. A consultation with a legal professional who specializes in healthcare or malpractice law is the only way to get a definitive answer tailored to your jurisdiction and the specific circumstances.\n\nWhile navigating these complex legal and ethical questions, I gently encourage you to seek support for your own grief. This is a tremendous burden to carry alone. Connecting with a therapist specializing in traumatic loss or a support group for those who have lost loved ones to substance use could provide a compassionate space for your healing.

Do we have grounds for a lawsuit?", "answer": "I am so deeply sorry for the loss of your friend. This is a devastating and traumatic event, and the feelings of grief, anger, and confusion you are experiencing are completely understandable. It is profoundly painful to lose someone in this way, especially with the added layer of questions about what might have been done differently. Please know that your care for your friend and your search for answers in the wake of this tragedy speaks to your deep compassion.\n\nAs a counselor, my role is to support you through this grief, not to provide legal advice. The question of accountability and legal grounds is a complex one that depends entirely on the specific laws in your state, the contractual agreements of the sober living home, and the details of their policies. What I can advise is that these are questions for a qualified attorney who specializes in wrongful death or personal injury law. They can review the case, determine if there was a breach of a legal duty of care, and advise you on whether there are grounds for a lawsuit.\n\nWhile you explore these practical questions, I gently encourage you to also tend to your emotional well-being. A loss like this can bring up intense and complicated emotions. Speaking with a grief counselor or therapist, either individually or in a support group for those who have lost loved ones to addiction, can be an invaluable source of support.

I've left two messages over the past week on her professional line, which states she responds within 48 hours, but I've heard nothing. Is it acceptable for her to not respond to a former client seeking to re-engage?", "answer": "Thank you for reaching out and sharing this situation. It's completely understandable to feel frustrated and even a bit hurt when your attempts to reconnect for support go unanswered, especially when you're taking the courageous step to resume your therapeutic work. Acknowledging the need to return to therapy is a significant act of self-awareness, and it's reasonable to expect a timely, professional response.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, while common courtesy and ethical guidelines encourage responsiveness, there are several possible reasons for the silence that are not a reflection of your worth as a client. Your former psychologist may be on leave, experiencing a family emergency, have a full caseload, or may have changed their practice status. Their 48-hour policy typically applies to current clients, and administrative protocols for former clients can sometimes differ. However, a lack of response after two attempts over a week does create a difficult limbo for you.\n\nMy primary guidance is to create a parallel plan so your well-being isn't dependent on this single point of contact. I encourage you to take these actionable steps:\n\n1.  **Make one more concise attempt**, perhaps via email if you have that address, stating your wish to re-establish care and asking for a referral if they are unavailable.\n2.  **Simultaneously, begin researching other therapists.** You can use psychologytoday.com, your insurance provider's directory, or ask your primary care physician for referrals. Reaching out to a few potential new therapists can empower you and restore a sense of forward momentum.\n3.  **If you are experiencing any crisis or safety concerns, please do not wait.** Contact a crisis line (988 in the US), go to your nearest emergency room, or seek immediate support from someone you trust.\n\nYour need for support is valid and important.

Does she have an obligation to respond to my attempt to re-establish care?", "answer": "Thank you for reaching out and sharing this situation. I can hear the frustration and uncertainty in your question, and it's completely understandable to feel that way when you've taken the proactive step to seek support again and haven't heard back. It can be disheartening and may bring up feelings of being overlooked, especially when you're motivated to re-engage in your therapeutic work.\n\nFrom a professional and ethical standpoint, while a counselor has a general duty to provide for client welfare, there is no universally mandated obligation to respond to a former client seeking to re-establish care after several months. However, best practice and common professional courtesy strongly suggest that a response—even a brief one to acknowledge your inquiry and explain availability or provide a referral—is the standard of care. The lack of response could be due to several factors, such as your message not being received, the counselor being out of office, a change in their practice status, or an oversight in a busy schedule.\n\nFor practical guidance, I recommend taking a two-step approach. First, give it a few more business days and then try one more clear, concise communication through the practice's main phone line or portal, stating your request to resume therapy and asking for a confirmation of receipt. If you still receive no reply, the second step is to seek care elsewhere. You can contact your insurance provider for a list of in-network therapists, use a reputable therapist directory, or ask your primary care physician for a referral. Your well-being is the priority, and you deserve to connect with a professional who is available and responsive to your needs.\n\nPlease know that your initiative to return to counseling is a significant and positive step for your mental health.

What you're describing sounds incredibly stressful and frightening. It is completely understandable to feel alarmed, powerless, and angry when you suspect your child's well-being is being compromised and your parental rights are being disregarded. Your protective instincts as a parent are valid, and wanting to ensure your child's safety is your most important role.\n\nAs a counselor, I must emphasize that this situation involves specific legal and ethical boundaries that require immediate professional guidance beyond what counseling can provide. My role here is to support you in navigating this with clarity and safety for your child.\n\nThe most critical step is to seek specialized legal counsel from a family law attorney who is experienced in high-conflict custody cases and parental rights. They can advise you on the specific laws in your jurisdiction regarding medical consent and the legal recourse available. Concurrently, I strongly recommend you document everything with dates, times, observations of your child's behavior, and any communications related to medication or treatment. Keep this record factual and objective.\n\nIf you have credible evidence that a mental health professional is acting unethically, you can file a complaint with their state licensing board. However, consulting your attorney before taking this step is crucial. Your focus must remain on your child's safety. If you believe your child is in immediate danger from unauthorized medication, contacting your pediatrician or local child protective services may be necessary.\n\nThis is an overwhelming path to walk alone.

However, I can offer guidance on the professional pathways to address this. What you are alleging—professional misconduct, potential medical malpractice, and intentional interference with parental rights—are serious matters that have specific legal and regulatory recourse.\n\nOn a practical level, I strongly encourage you to take the following steps, ideally with the support of your own attorney. First, immediately document everything: dates, times, names, medication details, and the specific allegations you believe were fabricated. Second, report the therapist to their state licensing board. This is a critical step to trigger an investigation into their professional conduct. Third, consult with a family law attorney regarding the custody and visitation issues, as the court needs to be informed of this potential manipulation. You may also need to consult with a civil attorney regarding potential lawsuits for malpractice or intentional infliction of emotional distress. Finally, if inappropriate medication was administered, filing a complaint with the medical board against the prescribing physician is also warranted.\n\nYour focus on your child's safety and well-being is paramount.

To have your therapy end abruptly, especially while receiving significant news about a potential diagnosis, is understandably distressing. Your feelings of confusion, frustration, or even abandonment are completely valid.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to acknowledge a professional boundary: as I am not your treating therapist and do not have the full context of your situation, I cannot speculate on the specific reasons for your therapist's actions. However, I can speak to general ethical practice. A therapist should provide appropriate closure and, when ending care, offer referrals to ensure continuity of support. The lack of a clear explanation in this instance is concerning.\n\nMy primary concern is your well-being and ensuring you have the support you need. A sudden mention of a possible bipolar disorder diagnosis, without a collaborative discussion or a plan for ongoing care, can be very destabilizing. **Your safety is paramount.** If you are experiencing any thoughts of harming yourself or others, please contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline or go to your nearest emergency room immediately.\n\nOn a practical level, I encourage you to take these steps:\n1.  **Seek Clarification:** Consider sending a brief, written request to your former therapist asking for clarification on the termination and a copy of your records, including any diagnostic assessment.\n2.  **Secure Ongoing Care:** The most important action is to connect with a new mental health professional.

{"id": "counsel_00925_aug_0", "question": "I'm dealing with severe depression, PTSD, and a personality disorder. During a recent visit, I was in a highly distressed state and ended up disclosing some sensitive information to my psychiatrist about a specific medication.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. I can hear how distressing this situation feels for you. It takes a great deal of courage to be vulnerable in a session, especially when you're already managing the significant weight of depression, PTSD, and a personality disorder. It's completely understandable to feel unsettled or even regretful after disclosing sensitive information, particularly when you were in a highly distressed state. Please know that your feelings are valid.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge your psychiatrist's role. As a prescribing professional, their primary concern is your safety and well-being. The information you shared, especially regarding medication, falls within the standard scope of their clinical assessment. While I understand it may feel exposing, this disclosure likely came from a place of needing help, which is exactly what therapy and psychiatry are for.\n\nA very practical and empowering next step would be to address this directly in your next session. You could say something like, \"After our last session, I've been feeling anxious about what I disclosed regarding my medication. Can we talk about that?\" This opens the door for you to process the event, understand your psychiatrist's perspective, and collaboratively clarify any boundaries or concerns about your treatment plan. This conversation can actually strengthen your therapeutic alliance.\n\nIt’s also important to have a plan for managing distress between sessions. Please continue to use any grounding techniques or crisis resources you have. If you have immediate safety concerns related to medication, please contact your psychiatrist's office, a crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency room. You are navigating complex challenges, and reaching out, even when it feels messy, is a sign of strength, not a failure.

I was very agitated in my last therapy session and confided in my clinician regarding a particular pharmaceutical treatment I was concerned about.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It sounds like your last session was a very intense and vulnerable experience. Confiding in your clinician about a serious concern, especially while feeling agitated, took significant courage. It's completely understandable to feel distressed when discussing pharmaceutical treatments, particularly when you are managing the weight of multiple diagnoses like MDD, severe anxiety, and PTSD. Your feelings of concern and agitation are valid reactions given what you're navigating.\n\nAs your counselor, I want to first acknowledge the strength it took to bring this forward in session. That is a crucial step in your care. Regarding the specific pharmaceutical concern you raised, I want to be transparent about my professional boundaries. While I can offer support around the emotional and psychological impact of medication, any detailed questions about dosage, side effects, or pharmaceutical specifics must be directed to your prescribing physician or psychiatrist. They have the medical training to address those concerns fully and safely. I encourage you to share these same worries with them, and we can even role-play how to start that conversation if it would feel helpful.\n\nFor now, let's focus on some grounding strategies to help manage the agitation you're feeling. When these concerns arise, try the \"5-4-3-2-1\" sensory exercise: notice five things you see, four you can touch, three you hear, two you smell, and one you taste. This can help anchor you in the present moment. Also, please know that if these feelings ever escalate to where you have thoughts of harming yourself or others, it is critical to reach out to your psychiatrist immediately, contact a crisis line, or go to the nearest emergency room.\n\nI am here to support you through the emotional journey of your treatment.

{"id": "counsel_00926_aug_0", "question": "What factors should a therapist consider when determining it's time to conclude therapy with a patient?", "answer": "Thank you for asking such an important and thoughtful question. It's clear you're considering the client's well-being deeply, which is at the heart of ethical practice. Navigating the conclusion of therapy is a significant responsibility, and feeling reflective about it is completely understandable.\n\nSeveral key factors should guide this decision, ideally as a collaborative process between you and the client. Primarily, we look at whether the original goals for therapy have been met. Has the client made meaningful progress toward the objectives you set together? Another crucial indicator is the client's increased sense of self-efficacy—do they feel more capable of handling life's challenges using the tools and insights gained in sessions? The therapeutic relationship itself is also a barometer; a natural sense of closure and a shift in the dynamic can signal readiness.\n\nIt's also essential to consider practical factors like sustained progress over time, not just temporary relief, and any external changes (like a move or financial shift) that may necessitate an adjustment. However, we must always be mindful of our own boundaries and competencies. If a client's needs have evolved beyond your scope of practice, a referral is the most ethical choice.\n\nMost importantly, this should never be an abrupt termination. We must proactively discuss and plan for the ending, processing the client's feelings about it and collaboratively creating a maintenance and relapse prevention plan. If there are any ongoing safety concerns, such as risk of harm to self or others, these must be thoroughly addressed and stabilized, with clear crisis resources in place, before concluding.\n\nThis transition is a profound phase of the work. By handling it with intention, care, and open communication, you help solidify the client's growth and honor the journey you've shared.", "topic": "professional-ethics", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00825"}
{"id": "counsel_00926_aug_1", "question": "In a school setting, how does a counselor know when to stop regular sessions with a student?", "answer": "Thank you for asking this important question. It’s clear you are thoughtfully considering the well-being of your students and the ethical management of your caseload, which is a cornerstone of effective school counseling. Navigating when to conclude regular sessions can indeed be complex, balancing a student's progress with the ongoing needs of the broader school community.\n\nProfessionally, the decision to stop regular sessions is typically guided by several key factors. The primary indicator is whether the initially identified counseling goals have been met. This is something we collaboratively assess with the student, reviewing the progress made on the issues that brought them in. For instance, if a student was seen for academic motivation and they have now developed consistent study habits and their grades have stabilized, we might transition to occasional check-ins. Another sign is when the student demonstrates increased resilience and has successfully applied coping strategies independently over a period of time.\n\nIt's also crucial to consider the scope of our role. School counseling is often short-term and solution-focused. If a student's needs become more intensive, chronic, or extend beyond the school's scope (e.g., requiring clinical diagnosis or long-term therapy), a referral to an outside mental health provider is the most ethical step. In this case, we would not simply \"stop,\" but would facilitate a warm handoff and possibly provide follow-up support at school to ensure continuity.\n\nWe must always prioritize safety. If there are any ongoing concerns about risk to self or others, sessions would not be terminated abruptly. Instead, we would ensure a robust safety plan is in place and that external providers or supports are actively involved.\n\nUltimately, transparency with the student and, as appropriate, their guardians, is vital. We frame the transition not as an ending, but as a graduation to a new phase, always leaving the door open for future check-ins. You are doing right by your students by reflecting on this process so carefully.", "topic": "professional-ethics", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00825"}
{"id": "counsel_00927_aug_0", "question": "My counselor, who I've seen for years, has always been very supportive and felt like a close confidant. Recently, she was in a financial bind and I offered a personal loan, which she repaid. But after a recent surgery where I was on pain medication, I have a vague memory of her being in my apartment to return money. Now she's stopped responding to my messages and canceled our sessions. I feel used and confused about this boundary crossing.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this deeply personal and troubling situation. I hear the confusion, hurt, and sense of betrayal you're experiencing. It's completely understandable to feel used and disoriented when a trusted therapeutic relationship changes so abruptly, especially given the vulnerable state you were in after surgery. The foundation of therapy is built on clear, professional boundaries designed to protect you, and it's clear those boundaries have become significantly blurred, which is not your fault.\n\nFrom a professional ethics standpoint, your counselor's acceptance of a personal loan was a serious boundary violation. Her subsequent visit to your apartment, while you were under the influence of pain medication, compounds this violation significantly and is unequivocally unethical. Her current withdrawal—ceasing communication and canceling sessions—is an abandonment of her professional responsibility and leaves you without proper closure or care.\n\nMy strongest recommendation is for you to seek support from a new, independent mental health professional. They can help you process this breach of trust and the complex feelings that come with it. To address the ethical violations, you have the right to file a formal complaint with her licensing board (such as your state's Board of Behavioral Health). This is not an act of vengeance, but a step to uphold professional standards and protect others.\n\nFor your immediate well-being, please lean on your personal support system. This was a profound breach of the therapeutic frame, and healing from it will require support that operates within clear, professional guidelines.

{"id": "counsel_00927_aug_1", "question": "I've been with my psychologist for over five years and we developed what felt like a genuine friendship. He's helped me through so much. When he had car trouble, I lent him money as a friend, and he paid it back. Last week, I was recovering from a procedure on strong medication, and I believe he came by to settle a debt. Since then, he's been distant and ended our therapeutic relationship abruptly. I'm hurt and don't know how to handle this ethical breach.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this deeply painful and confusing experience. I hear how hurt, confused, and betrayed you feel after a five-year therapeutic relationship has ended so abruptly and under such complicated circumstances. It is completely understandable to be grieving not only the loss of your psychologist's support but also the loss of what felt like a genuine friendship. You placed significant trust in this relationship, and its sudden end is a lot to process.\n\nFrom a professional ethics standpoint, I want to validate your perception. The core foundation of effective therapy is a relationship with clear, consistent boundaries designed to protect your well-being. Lending money, even between friends, and a home visit—especially when you were in a vulnerable state on medication—are significant boundary crossings that blur the professional relationship. The responsibility for maintaining these boundaries rests entirely with the psychologist. His subsequent distancing and termination, while likely his attempt to correct the boundary violation, were handled in a manner that has caused you further harm, which is not acceptable.\n\nMy primary concern is for your continuity of care. This rupture is a significant therapeutic issue in itself. I strongly encourage you to seek support from a new, licensed mental health professional. A new therapist can provide a safe, ethical space to process this painful termination, the boundary violations, and the original issues you were working on. This is not something you should have to navigate alone.\n\nIn the immediate term, be gentle with yourself. This is a loss. You might find it helpful to journal your thoughts and feelings about the relationship—both the positive support and the hurtful ending. If you feel it is appropriate, you can also contact your local psychology licensing board to seek information or file a complaint, as they oversee ethical conduct.

It’s completely understandable to want to connect with someone who is already walking the path you’re considering. That desire for mentorship and real-world insight is a wise and proactive step in your career planning. It shows you’re thinking thoughtfully about your future, which is something to be commended.\n\nAs a counselor, while I can support you in navigating the emotions and motivations behind this search, my role isn't to provide direct professional networking connections. However, I can offer some practical guidance on how to approach this ethically and effectively.\n\nA great first step is to leverage your existing academic or alumni networks. Reaching out to a professor or a career services office at your alma mater can often yield introductions. When you do connect with a professional, be clear and respectful of their time. You might send a concise, polite email or LinkedIn message stating your admiration for their work, your shared field of interest, and a request for a brief 15-20 minute informational interview. Prepare specific questions about their educational journey, day-to-day responsibilities, and what they find most and least fulfilling. This focused approach is often well-received.\n\nRemember to manage your expectations; not everyone will be able to respond, and that is not a reflection of your worth or potential. Rejection in this context is simply a matter of busy schedules. I encourage you to view this as an exploratory process, one that is as much about learning about different work environments as it is about specific roles.

It's completely understandable and very wise to want to gather firsthand information before committing to a career path. That proactive approach shows a great deal of self-awareness and investment in your future well-being. Feeling uncertain or wanting more clarity is a normal and healthy part of making such an important decision.\n\nWhat you're describing—conducting informational interviews—is an excellent and highly recommended strategy. It’s a practical way to move from abstract job descriptions to a real human perspective on the daily realities, challenges, and rewards of a role. Your focus on both academic background and day-to-day satisfaction is spot-on, as success in a field often depends on aligning both the required training and the actual lifestyle it creates.\n\nAs a counselor, my role isn't to facilitate those direct connections with professionals in other fields, but I can certainly help you prepare for them. We could explore how to identify and respectfully reach out to potential contacts, perhaps through your existing network or alumni associations. We can also work on formulating thoughtful questions that go beyond the basics to uncover the nuances of job satisfaction and work-life balance. Additionally, we can process the information you gather, helping you reflect on how it aligns with your own values, strengths, and long-term goals.\n\nThis is a positive step in your career exploration journey.

My therapist at the university counseling center has been incredibly supportive during my difficult adjustment period. As a token of my gratitude before I return home for the summer, I'd like to give him a bottle of our traditional liquor. Would this be considered an ethical gift in a therapeutic relationship?", "answer": "Thank you so much for sharing this thoughtful question. I can hear the genuine gratitude and appreciation you have for your therapist's support during what sounds like a challenging period of adjustment. It's a beautiful sentiment to want to express your thanks with a gift that represents your home culture. That connection to your heritage is important, and your desire to share it speaks volumes about the positive therapeutic relationship you've built.\n\nFrom a professional ethics standpoint, however, accepting a gift of alcohol, regardless of its cultural significance, would present a significant boundary issue for your therapist. Most professional codes of ethics for counselors and psychologists strongly discourage or outright prohibit accepting gifts of monetary value, especially those that could be misconstrued or create a dual relationship. A bottle of liquor, in particular, introduces complexities around the symbolism of alcohol in a therapeutic setting.\n\nI encourage you to share this feeling of gratitude directly with your therapist. Telling him how much his support has meant to you is an incredibly valuable gift in itself. You could also write a heartfelt card expressing your thanks, perhaps including a description or even a picture of the traditional liquor and its cultural significance. This allows you to share the meaningful aspect of your culture without putting your therapist in an ethically difficult position.\n\nIt's clear you have a strong, respectful connection with your therapist. Discussing this with him directly in your session would be a wonderful way to navigate this. He can acknowledge your kindness, and together you can find an alternative way to honor this transition that feels good to you and remains within the ethical framework that protects your therapeutic relationship.", "topic": "professional-ethics", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00828"}

Is it professionally appropriate for me to offer this to her?", "answer": "Thank you so much for sharing this. First, I want to acknowledge how difficult it can be to navigate a major life transition like moving abroad for studies, and I'm so glad to hear that you have found such valuable support in your counselor. Your desire to express gratitude is completely understandable and speaks to the positive and meaningful connection you've built in your therapeutic work.\n\nFrom a professional ethics standpoint, this is a thoughtful question. In the UK, as in many places, counseling professional bodies like the BACP have clear guidelines on gifts. Generally, accepting gifts is discouraged as it can subtly alter the professional therapeutic relationship, which needs to remain focused solely on your wellbeing. A gift, especially one of monetary or significant cultural value, could create a sense of obligation or blur those important boundaries.\n\nHowever, your intention comes from a place of genuine cultural sharing and thanks. A more appropriate alternative, which would likely be deeply appreciated by your counselor, would be a handwritten card or letter expressing what her support has meant to you. You could beautifully describe the significance of the wine and your region within that letter, sharing the cultural meaning without presenting the physical gift itself. This allows you to express your gratitude fully and personally, while fully respecting the ethical framework that protects your therapeutic space.\n\nYour thoughtfulness is a testament to your progress. I encourage you to bring this question directly to your counselor in your next session.

It takes significant courage to undergo bariatric surgery and to confront the complex challenges that can follow, including binge eating and the resurfacing of childhood trauma. It's completely understandable to feel frustrated and to question your therapy process when you're not receiving the guidance you're seeking. Your feelings are valid, and your desire for a more engaged therapeutic relationship is a reasonable expectation.\n\nFrom a professional ethics standpoint, therapeutic styles do vary. Some therapists use a non-directive, client-led approach, while others are more interactive and directive. However, the core of effective therapy is a collaborative alliance where you feel heard, supported, and actively working toward your goals. After six months, if you consistently feel unsupported and without direction, it is appropriate to address this directly with your therapist. I encourage you to voice these concerns in your next session. You could say something like, \"I've been thinking about our work together, and I realize I need more structured guidance with my binge eating and trauma. Can we discuss adjusting our approach?\" Their response will be very telling.\n\nYour situation involves significant psychological and physical health components. It is crucial that you are working with a professional who has specific experience in trauma-informed care and eating disorders, particularly post-bariatric surgery. If, after a frank conversation, you do not feel a shift in the therapeutic dynamic, seeking a second opinion or a referral to a specialist would be a proactive and self-caring step.

A strong therapeutic relationship is the foundation for this work. Given the depth of the issues you've outlined, which touch on trauma, addiction, and behavioral patterns, it is crucial that you feel your counselor is a capable guide. If you feel stuck, the most constructive and ethical next step would be to address this directly with your counselor. I encourage you to share these exact feelings in your next session. You could say something like, \"I value our work, but I'm feeling a need for more structured feedback or direction on my compulsive behaviors.\" This gives your counselor a chance to adjust their approach.\n\nIf, after an open conversation, you still feel unsupported, it may be appropriate to seek a consultation with another professional, perhaps one who specializes in trauma-informed care, eating disorders, and addiction.

What are some effective ways to manage this constant pressure?", "answer": "Thank you for reaching out and sharing what you're experiencing. It takes courage to acknowledge feeling overwhelmed, and I want you to know that your feelings are completely valid. Many people find themselves in a similar place, especially when the demands of life seem to pile up all at once. That constant pressure can be exhausting, both mentally and physically.\n\nAs a first step, I often encourage clients to practice a simple but powerful technique called \"grounding.\" When you feel the pressure mounting, pause for just 60 seconds. Take a few slow, deep breaths, and then name five things you can see, four things you can feel, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This can help bring you back to the present moment and temporarily slow the feeling of being swamped.\n\nNext, let's look at that \"plate.\" When everything feels like a top priority, it can be helpful to externalize it. I suggest taking 15 minutes to write down every single task, obligation, and worry. Then, categorize them: What is truly urgent (needs attention in the next 48 hours)? What is important but can be scheduled for later? And what can be delegated, simplified, or even let go of? This act of \"brain dumping\" and organizing can make things feel more manageable.\n\nIt's also crucial to remember that managing stress is not just about tackling tasks; it's about caring for your foundation. Prioritizing even small acts of self-care—like a short walk, staying hydrated, or ensuring you get enough sleep—is not a luxury; it's essential for resilience.\n\nIf these feelings of being overwhelmed persist, intensify, or begin to significantly impact your sleep, appetite, or mood, I strongly encourage you to consider speaking with a counselor or therapist in your area.

A practical starting point is to conduct a gentle audit of your current commitments. Are there any tasks, at work or home, that can be temporarily simplified, delegated, or even set aside? Even small efficiencies can create pockets of relief.\n\nCrucially, self-care is not a luxury; it is a necessity for your capacity to care for others. This doesn't need to be time-consuming.

Prioritizing brief moments of respite is key.\n\nIt is also vital to communicate openly with your partner, if applicable, about sharing the mental and physical load of parenting and household duties. Consider speaking with your employer about flexible arrangements, if possible.

This can help move the feeling from a general sense of overwhelm to a more manageable list of specific tasks.\n\nIn terms of immediate coping, grounding techniques can be very effective when the feeling becomes intense. Try the 5-4-3-2-1 method: name five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one you can taste. This brings your nervous system back to the present. Also, please remember the importance of foundational self-care—even when time is tight. Prioritizing sleep, hydration, and short breaks for deep breathing can significantly impact your resilience.\n\nIf these feelings persist, intensify, or begin to affect your ability to function in your daily roles, I strongly encourage you to consider speaking with a counselor or therapist in your area. They can provide personalized support and strategies tailored to your specific situation. My role here is to offer general guidance, but ongoing, one-on-one support is invaluable for navigating chronic stress.\n\nPlease be gentle with yourself. Managing pressure is not about eliminating everything on your plate, but about finding sustainable ways to carry it. You've taken a positive first step by seeking out strategies.", "topic": "stress", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00832"}
{"id": "counsel_00933_aug_1", "question": "As a new parent, I'm constantly stressed and exhausted. Do you have any strategies for coping with this kind of daily strain?", "answer": "Thank you for reaching out and for sharing what you're going through. First, I want to validate what you're feeling. The transition to parenthood is a profound life change, and feeling constantly stressed and exhausted is an incredibly common, yet deeply challenging, experience. It speaks to how much you care and how hard you're working. Please know that your feelings are completely understandable and you are not alone in this.\n\nWhat you're describing—the daily strain of new parenthood—can feel all-consuming. It's important to remember that caring for yourself is not a luxury; it's a necessity for being able to care for your little one. Let's explore a few practical strategies that many new parents find helpful.\n\nFirst, try to focus on **micro-moments of restoration**. Even 60 seconds of focused, deep breathing while the baby is safe in their crib can help regulate your nervous system. Second, **lower your standards** on non-essential tasks. The dishes can wait; if you have a moment of quiet, prioritize sitting down over cleaning. Third, **practice \"tag-team\" parenting** with your partner, if applicable. Schedule brief, predictable breaks where one of you is completely \"off duty,\" even if it's just for a 20-minute walk or a cup of tea in solitude. Fourth, **identify one or two people you can be honest with** about the struggle, beyond just the joys. Social connection is a powerful buffer against stress.\n\nI also want to gently mention that persistent exhaustion and stress can sometimes overlap with postpartum mood and anxiety disorders. If your stress ever feels unmanageable, if you have intrusive worries, or if you feel a deep sense of sadness or detachment, I encourage you to speak with your doctor or a mental health professional. This is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\nYou are navigating one of life's most demanding roles. Be as compassionate with yourself as you are with your new baby. Small, consistent acts of self-care can build resilience over time. You're doing a great job by simply looking for ways to cope.", "topic": "stress", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00832"}

The financial pressure is constant, and I find myself constantly anxious, lying awake at night going over every detail and what could go wrong.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. What you're describing sounds incredibly overwhelming, and it makes complete sense that you're feeling this constant anxiety. Juggling a full-time job, freelance work, and caring for your parents is a tremendous amount of responsibility for one person to carry. The financial pressure and those sleepless nights, where your mind races through every possible scenario, are clear signs that your stress has reached a significant level. Please know that your feelings are a valid response to an extremely demanding situation.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge your strength and dedication. It's clear you care deeply for your family and are working very hard. However, carrying this load alone is not sustainable. My primary recommendation would be to consider seeking support from a therapist in your area. A professional can provide a confidential space to unpack these burdens, develop personalized strategies for managing anxiety, and help you establish boundaries to prevent burnout. This is a sign of proactive self-care, not weakness.\n\nOn a practical level, let's look at what you can do to create some immediate relief. The anxiety at night is often a sign that your brain needs a dedicated \"worry time\" during the day. Try setting aside 15 minutes in the early evening to write down all your concerns and potential solutions. When worries pop up at night, gently remind yourself, \"I have a plan for that, and I will address it during my worry time tomorrow.\" Also, please explore any local resources for aging adults, such as respite care or senior day programs, which could offer you brief periods of relief. Even small breaks are crucial.\n\nYou are not alone in this. Reaching out is the first, and often hardest, step.

The weight of all these responsibilities makes me feel like I'm always on edge. I obsess over bills and the future, and it's hard to quiet my mind.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. What you're describing sounds incredibly demanding, and it makes complete sense that you feel on edge. Juggling the roles of sole provider, student, parent, and homemaker is a monumental task for anyone, let alone in your mid-20s. The constant pressure and the mental loop of worries about bills and the future are a natural response to carrying so much alone. Please know that your feelings are valid, and your dedication to your child and your future is truly commendable.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge the weight of this. When our minds are constantly in \"survival mode,\" planning and worrying, it's exhausting. A helpful starting point can be to deliberately carve out tiny moments—even five minutes—to interrupt that cycle. This isn't about adding another task, but about a brief reset. Try a simple grounding exercise: pause, name five things you can see, four you can feel, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one you can taste. This can help anchor you in the present.\n\nPractically, I encourage you to conduct a \"responsibility audit.\" Write down every single task you manage. Be ruthless in identifying what is essential and what could be simplified, deferred, or delegated. Are there community resources, family members, or a parenting co-op at your child's school that could offer even minor support? Even one less thing on your list can reduce the pressure.\n\nIt is crucial to note that when stress feels this constant and overwhelming, speaking with a professional counselor can provide dedicated space to develop personalized strategies and long-term coping tools. What you are doing is hard, and you deserve support. You are not failing; you are navigating an immense set of challenges.

{"id": "counsel_00935_aug_0", "question": "I'm wondering if my sexual preferences are considered a kink or if they're within the normal range.", "answer": "Thank you for reaching out and sharing this question with me. It takes courage to explore and reflect on your own sexuality, and I want to first acknowledge and validate that. It's very common to wonder where our personal preferences fit on the spectrum of human experience, and your curiosity is a healthy part of self-understanding.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, the concepts of \"normal,\" \"kink,\" or \"fetish\" are not always clear-cut. Human sexuality is a vast and diverse continuum. What is most important is whether your preferences are a source of personal distress, cause harm to yourself or others, or significantly impair your daily functioning or relationships. If they are consensual, safe, and bring you or your partner(s) fulfillment without causing distress, they often fall within a healthy range of sexual expression, regardless of the label.\n\nA helpful next step could be to gently explore a few questions for yourself: Do these preferences feel integrated and manageable in your life? Are you able to engage with them in a way that feels emotionally and physically safe? Is there any shame or anxiety attached to them that you'd like to address? If these reflections bring up uncertainty or discomfort, discussing them with a certified sex therapist or a counselor specializing in sexuality can be incredibly beneficial. They provide a confidential, non-judgmental space to explore these feelings in depth.\n\nPlease remember, your sexuality is a personal and unique part of you. My role is to support you in finding a relationship with it that feels authentic, safe, and satisfying. If at any point your thoughts or behaviors feel compulsive, risky, or distressing, I strongly encourage you to seek that professional support for more personalized guidance.

It takes courage to reflect on and discuss the intimate aspects of a relationship, and I want to start by validating that your feelings and your curiosity are completely normal. Many couples navigate differences in sexual interests, and it's a sign of a healthy relationship that you're seeking to understand this more deeply.\n\nThe distinction between a \"common variation\" and a \"fetish\" can feel confusing, as these terms are often used loosely. In a clinical sense, a fetish typically refers to a specific object or non-genital body part that is intensely focused on for sexual arousal and is often necessary for sexual satisfaction. What many people call a fetish is more accurately a strong preference or a kink—a less common but still healthy variation of sexual expression. The most important questions are: Does this interest cause you distress or dysfunction? Is it consensual and safe? If the answers are no and yes, respectively, it often falls within the broad spectrum of human sexuality.\n\nA key step is open, compassionate communication with your partner. Approach the conversation from a place of sharing your own feelings (\"I feel...\") rather than making demands. The goal is mutual understanding, not immediate agreement. Exploring resources together, like books or websites from reputable sex therapists, can also help normalize the discussion.\n\nIf this difference is causing significant distress, conflict, or feelings of shame, seeking guidance from a certified sex therapist can be incredibly beneficial. They provide a neutral space to explore these dynamics and find a path forward that honors both partners.

It takes a great deal of courage to articulate these intertwined feelings of attraction and pain. First, I want to validate that your experience is deeply understandable. It is very common for our minds to weave together threads of early sexual development, trauma, and desire, creating a tapestry that can feel confusing and even shameful. The assault you experienced was a violation of your boundaries and autonomy, and it is completely normal for that experience to create significant emotional conflict now, especially when it intersects with your attractions.\n\nWhat you're describing—having an attraction that also feels connected to a traumatic event—is a profound challenge that many people face in various forms. The shame you carry is a heavy burden, but please know that your attractions themselves are not wrong or shameful. The trauma, however, is a separate wound that needs compassionate attention. It is often very difficult to untangle these threads alone, and this is where working with a professional can be incredibly beneficial.\n\nI strongly encourage you to seek out a therapist, specifically one who is trained in trauma modalities (like EMDR or somatic therapy) and is also knowledgeable in human sexuality. A skilled therapist can provide a safe, non-judgmental space to process the assault, which is the source of the shame, while also helping you explore your attractions with curiosity and self-compassion. This separate, professional support is crucial because it allows you to address the trauma's impact on your life and relationships, which may help reduce the confusion and distress you're feeling.\n\nYou are not defined by your trauma or your attractions alone. You are a whole person deserving of understanding and peace. Taking the step to seek therapy is an act of profound self-care.

{"id": "counsel_00936_aug_1", "question": "As a young man, I've always been drawn to partners significantly older than me, but a past non-consensual experience with an older partner has layered a lot of guilt over these attractions.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing something so personal and complex. It takes courage to articulate this, and I want to start by validating both parts of what you've described. Your attractions are a part of your sexuality, and experiencing them is not wrong or something you need to feel guilty about. At the same time, the trauma of a non-consensual experience is profoundly significant, and it's completely understandable that it has created this painful layer of guilt and confusion. These two experiences—your innate attractions and the trauma—have become intertwined, and that is a heavy burden to carry.\n\nWhat you're describing is a common reaction to trauma, where something that was once a source of interest or pleasure becomes associated with fear, shame, and pain. The guilt you feel is not a reflection of your attractions being \"bad,\" but rather a protective emotional response from a deeply violating event. It's crucial to separate these two things with compassionate support.\n\nFor this reason, I strongly encourage you to consider seeking therapy with a professional who specializes in trauma, such as a therapist trained in EMDR or Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. They can provide a safe space to process the non-consensual experience, which is the first and most critical step. As you heal from the trauma, the guilt associated with your attractions will likely begin to lessen, allowing you to explore your sexuality from a place of safety and autonomy. A skilled therapist can also help you navigate consent, boundaries, and healthy relationship dynamics, which are essential for any future partnerships.\n\nPlease know that your feelings are heard, and healing from this is possible.

It's becoming a real problem because I can't focus on my work or personal goals.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes courage to voice something that feels so personal and concerning. First, I want to validate what you're experiencing. The feelings of loneliness, the intensity of your thoughts, and the frustration about your focus are all very real and understandable. Please know that having sexual thoughts and fantasies is a normal part of human sexuality, especially for a young adult. It doesn't mean something is physically wrong with you. Often, these thoughts can become more prominent when we are feeling a deep sense of loneliness or longing for connection—our minds can sometimes fixate on one pathway to that connection.\n\nWhat you're describing about the pervasiveness of the thoughts and their impact on your daily functioning is the most important piece here. When any thought pattern becomes intrusive and disrupts our work or goals, it's a signal to explore it more deeply. This is where working with a professional, like a therapist or counselor, could be incredibly beneficial. They can provide a confidential space to explore the roots of this loneliness, understand the role these fantasies are playing, and develop strategies to manage the intrusiveness.\n\nFor now, you might find it helpful to practice grounding techniques when you notice the thoughts pulling your focus. For example, gently redirect your attention to your physical senses—notice five things you can see, four you can feel, three you can hear. This isn't about suppressing the thoughts, but about giving yourself more control over your attention. Also, consider exploring safe, social outlets to address the loneliness, like joining a club or class based on an interest, which can foster connection in a less pressured way.\n\nYou are not broken. You are a person experiencing a common, though distressing, conflict between desire, loneliness, and daily life.

{"id": "counsel_00937_aug_1", "question": "As a guy in my early twenties without any sexual experience, I find myself frequently fantasizing about women I interact with daily. It creates a lot of internal tension and leaves me feeling hollow and inadequate. I socialize with plenty of people, but my mind keeps drifting to sexual scenarios, which distracts me from my studies and makes me question if I'm normal.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes courage to articulate these feelings, and I want you to know that what you're experiencing is a very common and human struggle. The internal tension, the feelings of hollowness and inadequacy—these are significant emotional experiences, and it's completely understandable that they are causing you distress. Many people, especially in their early twenties, grapple with the intersection of natural sexual feelings, societal expectations, and personal identity.\n\nFirst, let me offer a gentle reassurance: having sexual fantasies, including about people you know, is a normal part of human sexuality. Our brains are wired for connection and attraction. However, when these thoughts become intrusive, distracting, and lead to persistent negative feelings about yourself, it's a sign that they are impacting your well-being. This is the important piece to address—not the fantasies themselves, but the distress and self-judgment they are triggering.\n\nThe combination of distraction from your studies and questioning your normalcy tells me this is more than just a passing phase. A helpful next step would be to explore these patterns with more support. Consider speaking with a therapist, preferably one who specializes in sexuality or young adult issues. They can provide a confidential space to unpack these feelings without judgment, help you understand the root of the \"hollow\" sensation, and develop strategies to manage intrusive thoughts. Cognitive-behavioral techniques, for instance, can be very effective in gently redirecting focus and reducing the power these thoughts have over your day.\n\nIn the short term, practice self-compassion. When you notice the thoughts arising, acknowledge them without judgment—\"There's that thought again\"—and then consciously guide your attention back to the present task or interaction. Mindfulness exercises can strengthen this skill. Remember, your worth is not defined by your sexual experience. You are navigating a complex aspect of life, and seeking to understand it better is a sign of strength, not inadequacy.

Looking back, it feels incredibly awkward and confusing. It eventually progressed to helping each other out, and even though we said it was just 'experimenting,' I'm now wrestling with what it meant. I had buried the memory for years, but it's resurfaced and causing me a lot of distress.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes a great deal of courage to bring forward a memory that has been buried and is now causing you distress. What you're describing—the feelings of awkwardness, confusion, and current distress—are completely valid and understandable reactions. Many people have experiences in their past, particularly from formative times like college, that they later re-examine with a more complex adult perspective.\n\nIt’s very common for individuals to engage in sexual exploration with friends during adolescence and young adulthood. The term \"experimenting\" is often used because, at the time, it may have felt like a way to explore curiosity and sexuality in a safe, known context. However, when these memories resurface years later, they can clash with our current understanding of our identity, relationships, and personal boundaries, leading to significant confusion and emotional turmoil.\n\nFirst, I want to gently encourage you to practice self-compassion. Please try to avoid judging your past self through the lens of your present self. Your past actions were part of a specific context. A helpful first step can be to simply acknowledge the experience without immediately needing to define a permanent \"meaning\" for it. You might find it useful to journal about the feelings that are surfacing—not just the facts of the memory, but the emotions attached to it then and now.\n\nGiven the level of distress this is causing you, I strongly recommend exploring this with a licensed therapist, preferably one who specializes in human sexuality or LGBTQ+ affirming care. They can provide a confidential, non-judgmental space to process this memory, untangle the feelings of confusion, and help you integrate this experience into your broader life narrative in a way that feels peaceful for you. This isn't about pathologizing your experience, but about getting the dedicated support you deserve to find clarity and reduce your distress.\n\nYou are not alone in navigating this, and seeking support is a sign of strength.", "topic": "human-sexuality", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00837"}

At the time we thought it was just curiosity, but now as an adult, I feel deeply ashamed and confused about it. I convinced myself it was nothing, but the thoughts have come back recently, and I'm really struggling to process the experience and my feelings about it.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes courage to voice something that carries so much shame and confusion. First, I want to offer you a space of complete non-judgment. What you're describing—childhood sexual exploration with a peer close in age—is a relatively common human experience. Many children, driven by natural curiosity about their bodies, engage in some form of exploratory play. It’s important to understand that children do not have the cognitive or emotional framework of adults; they operate from a place of discovery, not the complex moral and social understandings we develop later.\n\nThe shame and confusion you're feeling now as an adult are completely valid. Our adult minds often re-examine past events through our current lens of ethics, relationships, and self-concept, which can create significant distress. It sounds like you may be grappling with questions about consent, normality, and what this means about you. Please know that this childhood experience does not define your character or your sexuality today.\n\nA crucial step in processing this is to gently separate the child's actions from the adult's judgment. The child you were was exploring; the adult you are is responsibly and compassionately trying to understand it. If these thoughts are causing significant ongoing distress, I strongly encourage you to seek support from a licensed therapist. A professional can provide a confidential space to unpack these feelings, help you contextualize the experience within your life narrative, and offer strategies to release the shame. Therapy can be incredibly effective in transforming shame into understanding and self-compassion.\n\nYou are not alone in this, and your feelings are worthy of care and attention.

{"id": "counsel_00939_aug_0", "question": "I often post in our group chat or send DMs to friends, but it feels like I'm being ignored. They'll see the messages but not reply. It makes me wonder if I've done something to upset them or if they just don't enjoy talking to me. How can I encourage more engagement in our conversations?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It's completely understandable to feel hurt and confused when your messages seem to go unanswered, especially by friends. That sense of being ignored can be very painful, and it's natural to start questioning your relationships or your own actions. Please know that your feelings are valid, and many people have experienced this in our digital age where communication cues can be so ambiguous.\n\nWhile I can offer some general guidance, it's important to remember that as an online counselor, I don't have the full context of your relationships. If these feelings are causing significant distress or impacting your self-worth, connecting with a local therapist for ongoing support could be very beneficial.\n\nLet's explore some practical steps. First, consider the medium and timing. A busy group chat can easily bury messages, and a DM might be seen during a hectic moment with the intent to reply later, only to be forgotten. You might try gently changing your approach. Instead of an open-ended message, you could ask a specific, low-pressure question like, \"I'd love your thoughts on this when you have a moment,\" or suggest a concrete plan. Also, try shifting some interactions to voice or video calls, or in-person meetups when possible. These often foster more direct engagement.\n\nPay attention to patterns. Is this happening with all friends, or one specific group? If it's a consistent issue with certain individuals, it might be worth having a gentle, non-accusatory one-on-one conversation. You could say, \"I've noticed I'm not getting many replies lately. Is everything okay between us?\" This focuses on your feelings rather than blaming them.\n\nFinally, please be kind to yourself. A lack of response is often more about others' busy lives, communication styles, or the overwhelming nature of digital communication than it is about you or your worth as a friend. Nurture connections with those who reciprocate your effort, and consider investing your energy there.

What can I do to improve my chances of getting a reply and feel less anxious about being ignored?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It's completely understandable to feel insecure and anxious when you notice your messages have been read but not answered. That experience of being left on \"read\" can trigger feelings of rejection and self-doubt, and it's a very common frustration in our digitally-connected world. Please know your feelings are valid.\n\nFirst, let's gently separate the *fact* of a delayed response from the *story* we might tell ourselves about it. While it's easy to assume it's about your communication style, there are countless other reasons for a delayed reply—your colleague could be overwhelmed, distracted, intending to reply later and forgetting, or simply not have the mental bandwidth at that moment. Their response (or lack thereof) is often more about their own context than a reflection of you.\n\nTo improve your chances of a reply, you can make your messages clear, concise, and easy to answer. State your purpose upfront and, if appropriate, include a specific call to action or question. For time-sensitive matters, it's okay to politely use phrases like, \"No rush, but hoping for your thoughts by EOD Thursday.\" For non-urgent social outreach, consider that some connections simply prefer different channels or in-person interaction.\n\nTo manage the anxiety, I encourage you to practice self-compassion. When you feel that worry arise, take a few deep breaths and remind yourself of other successful interactions you've had. Consider limiting how often you check \"read receipts,\" as this can fuel anxiety. If you find these thoughts are persistently impacting your self-esteem or daily functioning, exploring this with a therapist could provide deeper support.

It takes courage to acknowledge when a dynamic within your friend group is causing you discomfort, especially when it seems like everyone else is on a different page. Your feelings are completely valid. It's understandable to feel uneasy and frustrated when constant sarcasm makes you feel like you can't engage in genuine, meaningful conversation. That longing for connection and seriousness is a very human need.\n\nWhat you're describing can be emotionally draining over time. Sarcasm, even when not intended to be malicious, can create a barrier to authentic connection and make it hard to feel safe expressing yourself. It's important to honor your own communication style and your need for interactions that feel substantive and respectful.\n\nAs a first step, I encourage you to reflect on what you need from these friendships. When you're in a calm moment, perhaps with one friend you trust the most, you could gently express how you feel using \"I\" statements. For example, \"I've been feeling a bit out of sync lately. I really value our time together, but sometimes the constant witty remarks make it hard for me to feel like I can just be serious. Could we maybe have a coffee chat where we just catch up without the banter?\" This focuses on your experience without blaming them.\n\nIf, after setting these gentle boundaries, the pattern continues and leaves you feeling consistently dismissed or belittled, it may be worth considering whether these friendships are meeting your core relational needs. Your comfort and emotional safety are paramount. If these feelings are significantly impacting your mood or self-esteem, connecting with a counselor for ongoing support could be very beneficial in navigating these social dynamics and strengthening your communication skills.

{"id": "counsel_00940_aug_1", "question": "My partner's family always has a 'clever' quip or teasing comment about every situation. It's meant to be lighthearted, but it creates an awkward atmosphere and I never know how to respond.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes a lot of self-awareness to recognize how this dynamic is affecting you, and it's completely understandable to feel awkward and unsure in that situation. What you're describing is a common, yet challenging, scenario where one family's established culture of humor can feel exclusionary or even critical to an outsider, even if no ill intent is meant. Your feelings of discomfort are valid.\n\nNavigating this requires a two-part approach: managing your internal reaction and finding external ways to engage. First, it can be helpful to reframe the comments internally. Remind yourself that this is likely their default mode of connection—a family \"language.\" This isn't to dismiss your feelings, but to potentially reduce the personal sting. In the moment, you might try a few neutral, graceful responses that don't fuel the teasing but also don't show offense. A simple, smiling \"You all are something else,\" or a light, curious \"Is that the family motto?\" can acknowledge the comment without engaging in the content. Changing the subject by asking a genuine question about another topic is also a very effective tool.\n\nIt's also crucial to communicate with your partner. In a calm moment, share your experience using \"I feel\" statements—\"I feel a bit on the spot and unsure how to react when the teasing starts.\" A supportive partner can help by subtly redirecting conversations or, if appropriate, having a private word with their family about the impact.\n\nIf this dynamic is causing significant distress, creating tension in your relationship, or if the teasing ever crosses into genuinely hurtful territory, seeking a few sessions with a couples or family therapist could provide a safe space to develop more tailored strategies.

It takes courage to acknowledge these feelings, and I want you to know that what you're experiencing is deeply valid. Feeling hurt and undervalued when your efforts in friendship aren't reciprocated is a painful and lonely experience. Many people struggle with this dynamic, and your desire for balanced, meaningful connections is completely understandable and healthy.\n\nIt can be helpful to first gently explore these feelings. When you notice this pattern, what thoughts come up for you? Do you find yourself questioning your own worth, or feeling like you have to earn friendship through constant effort? Often, we can fall into patterns where we over-function in relationships, sometimes without even realizing it. This isn't your fault, but understanding it can be a first step toward change.\n\nOn a practical level, you might consider a two-part approach. First, try a compassionate \"pause.\" Instead of initiating plans or check-ins for a set period, observe what happens. This isn't a test or a punishment, but a way to gather information about the natural flow of these friendships. Second, when you do reconnect, you could use \"I feel\" statements to express your needs in a low-confrontational way. For example, \"I really value our friendship, and I've noticed I sometimes feel a bit lonely between our meetups. I'd love it if we could both try to reach out more.\"\n\nPlease remember that your worth is not defined by the effort you expend in relationships. If these feelings are leading to significant distress, loneliness, or impacting your self-esteem, speaking with a counselor one-on-one could provide a supportive space to explore these patterns more deeply.

{"id": "counsel_00941_aug_1", "question": "It's discouraging when family members you care about don't seem to prioritize staying connected or maintaining our bond.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It is deeply discouraging and painful when the connections we value with family don't feel reciprocated in the way we hope. That sense of caring more, or investing more effort, can lead to feelings of loneliness, rejection, and grief, even within a family unit. Your feelings are completely valid and understandable.\n\nWhat you're describing touches on a fundamental human need for secure attachment and belonging. When that feels unstable with family, it can shake our foundation. It's important to first acknowledge this hurt without judgment toward yourself. You might gently explore the expectations and hopes you have for these relationships. Sometimes, differing capacities for connection—stemming from their own life stresses, emotional histories, or personal challenges—can drive this dynamic, though it never makes the sting less real.\n\nAs a starting point for coping, I encourage you to focus on what is within your control. You can clearly, and kindly, communicate your need for connection. A simple, non-accusatory \"I miss you and would love to find a time to catch up\" expresses your desire without placing blame. Simultaneously, it can be vital to nurture other relationships and parts of your life that provide fulfillment and reciprocity. This isn't about replacing family, but about building a support network that honors your effort.\n\nPlease know that this type of relational strain is a common reason people seek counseling. A therapist can offer a supportive space to process this grief, establish healthy boundaries, and develop strategies for communication. If these feelings ever lead to pervasive sadness or hopelessness, reaching out to a professional is a strong and important step.

I've asked if we could plan a specific call, but he says his routine is non-negotiable. I'm also worried because he's mixing daily cannabis use with his prescribed mood stabilizers.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It sounds like you're in a difficult and frustrating situation, and it's clear you care deeply about your friend. Feeling dismissed and unheard when you're trying to maintain a meaningful connection across a distance is painful. It's completely understandable to feel hurt when your attempts to connect are met with distraction, and it's responsible of you to be observant and concerned about his well-being regarding his medication and substance use.\n\nI want to acknowledge the complexity here. Your desire for quality time is valid, and his stated need for a non-negotiable routine is also a reality. However, a healthy relationship requires some mutual flexibility. Since directly changing his behavior hasn't worked, we might focus on what you can control. You could consider adjusting your expectations for these calls—perhaps framing them as casual, low-pressure check-ins where distractions are expected, while seeking deeper connection through other means, like scheduled letter-writing or sharing a podcast. This can protect you from the repeated disappointment.\n\nThe most significant part of your concern, however, is the safety aspect. Mixing daily cannabis with prescribed mood stabilizers is a serious matter that can interfere with the medication's efficacy and stability. This moves beyond a relational issue into a health concern. As a friend, you can express your care and concern about this specifically, using \"I\" statements: \"I care about you, and I get worried when I hear about the cannabis use with your medication because I want you to be safe.\" Ultimately, his health choices are his responsibility. You cannot manage this for him, but you can encourage him to have an open conversation with his prescribing doctor or therapist about the interaction. That is the most important step he could take.\n\nPlease remember to also tend to your own emotional needs. Investing in local connections and activities can help balance the energy you put into this strained long-distance friendship. You're showing great compassion, and it's okay to also set boundaries that honor your own time and emotional well-being.", "topic": "social-relationships", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00841"}

Our scheduled calls keep getting cut short because their young children need attention. When I proposed finding a more quiet time, they dismissed the idea, insisting their family schedule can't adapt. It's concerning to me that they're also taking sleep aids while having several glasses of wine each night.", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It sounds like you're carrying a lot of concern and disappointment, which is completely understandable. It's painful to feel a growing distance from a sibling you care about, especially when your efforts to connect are met with logistical and emotional barriers. Your desire for a meaningful connection is valid, and it's clear your concern extends beyond the missed calls to their overall well-being.\n\nThe situation you've described has a few layers. On one level, we have the practical challenge of maintaining a long-distance relationship amidst the demanding reality of young children. It's common for parents to be in \"survival mode,\" and their dismissal of schedule changes may stem from feeling overwhelmed rather than a lack of care for you. We could explore creative ways to connect that might fit their chaos—perhaps short video messages, a shared digital journal, or even a call where you read a story to the children first, transitioning to adult talk afterward.\n\nHowever, I must acknowledge the more serious layer you've raised. Your observation about the combination of sleep aids and alcohol each night is a significant safety concern. This pattern can be dangerous and often indicates someone is struggling to cope. As your sibling's counselor, I cannot diagnose or intervene directly, but I encourage you to treat this with the gravity it deserves. When you do speak, you might express your care from a place of love: \"I love you, and I've noticed you seem really stressed lately. I'm worried about how you're managing everything.\" Avoid accusations, and focus on their health. If you have other family members nearby who can offer a supportive check-in, that could be helpful.\n\nYour feelings matter, and so does your sibling's safety. Balancing your need for connection with the reality of their current situation is difficult. Please remember to nurture your own support systems during this time.

It's clear you're carrying a lot of weight from this situation, and I want to acknowledge how much you're hurting. Feeling terrible and being unable to stop thinking about it shows you have a strong sense of empathy and regret, which are important qualities. It's understandable that you're distressed, both by the fallout for your friend and the strain in your relationship with her.\n\nWhat you're describing is a complex interpersonal situation with real consequences. Your roommate's anger is a natural reaction to her professional environment becoming awkward and potentially compromised, and your guilt is a signal that this crossed a personal value for you. A crucial first step is to offer a sincere and full apology to your roommate, without excuses. Acknowledge that you pushed her into something she was hesitant about, that you now see it was unwise, and that you regret the position it put her in at work. The goal isn't to immediately fix your friendship, but to take full responsibility.\n\nIt's also important to consider how to make amends. Ask your roommate, without pressure, if there's anything you can do to support her as she navigates the awkwardness at work. Beyond that, I encourage you to reflect on what led to pushing the joke initially. Was it boredom, a desire for connection, or something else? Understanding that impulse can be a powerful learning moment to prevent similar situations.\n\nIf these ruminations become overwhelming or start to significantly impact your mood or daily functioning, I would gently suggest speaking with a counselor for a few sessions. They can provide a dedicated space to work through the guilt and develop healthier interpersonal strategies. For now, practice self-compassion alongside your accountability.

I can hear how much distress this situation is causing you, and I want to start by validating that what you're feeling—the guilt, the worry, the regret—is completely understandable. It's clear you care deeply about your sibling and their friendship, and seeing the unintended consequences of a moment of joking has hit you hard. It's a painful reminder of how quickly our actions, even those meant in fun, can impact the people we love.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge the weight of this guilt, but also put it in perspective. You made a mistake in judgment, which is a very human experience. The intent was not malicious, but the outcome was hurtful. The most constructive path forward involves accountability and repair.\n\nA crucial step is to give your sibling the space they need right now. Their silence likely reflects their own hurt and confusion, not a permanent rejection of you. When the time feels right, I encourage you to write a sincere, non-defensive apology. Acknowledge specifically that pressuring them was wrong, express your remorse for the strain it caused in their friendship, and state clearly that you do not expect an immediate response. This allows them to process your words without pressure.\n\nWhile you wait for that opportunity, the overwhelming guilt needs an outlet. Please be compassionate with yourself. Consider journaling to process your thoughts, or channel this energy into something constructive that your sibling values. If these feelings of guilt become all-consuming or begin to significantly impact your daily functioning, I would gently suggest speaking with a counselor one-on-one. They can provide a supportive space to work through these complex emotions and develop strategies for self-forgiveness and patience.\n\nHealing in relationships takes time.

{"id": "counsel_00944_aug_0", "question": "I had a close mentor in my professional field for several years. The relationship was helpful in some ways, but often felt inappropriate and controlling. He would twist the truth and gaslight me, but our colleagues only see his charming public persona. When I tried to speak up, I was labeled as problematic and jealous. Now we're estranged, and it's unsettling because he holds a lot of influence and everyone trusts him. How can I be certain my perception of the situation is accurate?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes a great deal of courage to articulate such a complex and painful experience, especially when it involves someone widely respected. What you're describing—feeling controlled, gaslit, and then isolated when you tried to speak up—is deeply unsettling and invalidating. Your feelings of confusion and unsettlement are completely understandable given the power dynamics and social repercussions you've faced.\n\nFirst, I want to validate that your perception is worthy of trust. Gaslighting, by its very nature, is designed to make you doubt your own reality. The fact that you noticed a stark contrast between his private behavior and public persona is a significant observation. Often in these situations, our physiological and emotional responses—feelings of anxiety, dread, or a knot in your stomach before interactions—are important data points that confirm something is amiss, even when the logical evidence feels obscured.\n\nA helpful step can be to engage in a process of reality-testing outside of that environment. Could you confidentially speak with a therapist? An objective professional can provide a safe space to untangle your experiences without any conflict of interest. Additionally, you might begin privately journaling specific incidents, noting dates, what was said, and how it made you feel. This can help solidify your narrative against the fog of gaslighting.\n\nYour safety and well-being are paramount. While navigating this professional landscape, it may be necessary to set firm, internal boundaries regarding your expectations of this individual and the colleagues who dismissed you. Prioritize connecting with supportive people outside this immediate circle who affirm your worth.

I ended the closeness, but I'm anxious because he's in a respected role and no one sees what I saw. How do I find clarity and trust my own judgment?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. What you're describing sounds incredibly difficult and isolating. It takes significant courage to end a close relationship, especially when it's with someone who has been a guide and is widely respected. Please know that your feelings of confusion, anxiety, and the need for clarity are completely valid and understandable.\n\nFirst, I want to affirm a crucial point: your experience is real. The dissonance between your private experience and the public perception of this person is deeply disorienting. It is common for individuals who use manipulation to cultivate a spotless public image, which can make their private targets feel doubly betrayed and unsure of themselves. Trusting your own judgment begins with honoring the discomfort and hurt you felt—those emotional responses are important data.\n\nTo find clarity, I gently suggest a few steps. Consider writing a private journal, detailing specific incidents of manipulation or deceit. This isn't for sharing, but to externalize the memories and affirm your reality. You might also explore, with a professional therapist, the dynamics of coercive control and emotional manipulation. A counselor can provide a confidential, objective space to process this without the community pressures your family may unintentionally be applying.\n\nYour decision to create distance was an act of self-protection. Continue to honor that boundary. You do not need to convince your family or the community; your primary task is to heal and reaffirm trust in yourself.

It is completely valid to feel upset and on edge when you're consistently the target of subtle, pointed comments, especially in a professional setting where your reputation matters. That feeling of being singled out, while others seem unaware, can be deeply distressing and can make you question your own perceptions. Please know that your experience is real, and your concerns about being labeled \"overly sensitive\" are a common and understandable fear in these situations.\n\nGiven the complexity of workplace dynamics, my role is to offer support and strategies, but I must also note that for ongoing, in-depth support, engaging with a counselor one-on-one could be very beneficial. For now, let's focus on some practical steps you can consider.\n\nFirst, I encourage you to start privately documenting each incident. Note the date, time, what was said, the context, and any witnesses. This isn't about building a case for escalation yet, but it helps you track patterns and validate your experience.\n\nNext, consider a one-on-one, low-key approach. You could request a private conversation with this coworker. Using non-accusatory \"I\" statements, you might say, \"I've noticed in the last few meetings, when you made a comment about [topic], I felt it was directed at me. I may be misreading, but I wanted to check in directly to clear the air.\" This approach can sometimes disarm the behavior without a public confrontation. If the behavior continues or escalates, your documentation becomes crucial for a conversation with your supervisor or HR, framed as a concern for team cohesion and a respectful work environment.\n\nYour instinct to protect your professional reputation is wise.

What you're describing sounds incredibly painful and isolating. It takes a lot of strength to recognize this pattern of behavior for what it is—a form of covert bullying and emotional manipulation. Your feelings of hurt, frustration, and fear about the social repercussions are completely valid. Being targeted with coded mockery and then dismissed when you try to address it is a profound betrayal of trust, especially within a friend group.\n\nThe dynamic you've outlined is concerning. The shift from direct attacks to passive-aggressive, coded behavior, coupled with dismissive and gaslighting responses when you set a boundary, indicates this person is intentionally causing harm while maintaining plausible deniability. Your fear of them turning mutual friends against you is a real risk in these situations, and it's wise to be cautious.\n\nGiven the complexity, my first recommendation would be to consider speaking with a counselor one-on-one. They can provide a safe space to process this betrayal and help you build a personalized strategy for navigating the group dynamics. In the meantime, here are some practical steps to consider:\n\n1.  **Document the Behavior:** Keep a private log of the vagueposts and inside jokes, with dates and screenshots if possible. This isn't about confrontation, but about validating your own reality against the gaslighting.\n2.  **Shift Your Focus:** Instead of confronting the individual again directly, which hasn't been effective, consider shifting your energy toward strengthening individual connections with the other friends in the group. Nurture those relationships one-on-one through separate activities.\n3.  **Assess Your Options:** You may need to evaluate what this friendship group truly provides you. Sometimes, creating a bit of distance or gradually spending less time in the group setting can reduce your exposure to this toxic behavior and provide clarity.\n\nYour well-being is the priority.

It takes a great deal of self-awareness to recognize this pattern, and I want to acknowledge the courage it took to voice it. Feeling the need to build emotional barriers and push people away is often a sign that you've been hurt or felt vulnerable in the past. It's a protective mechanism, and your mind is trying to keep you safe, even if it now feels isolating.\n\nWhat you're describing is a common challenge, and it's something we can work through. The first step is often exploring, with curiosity rather than judgment, where this pattern began. When did you first feel that being open was unsafe? Understanding the origin can help separate past experiences from your present relationships.\n\nAs a starting point, I encourage you to practice small acts of vulnerability with someone you feel has earned a bit of your trust. This doesn't mean dismantling all your walls at once. It could be sharing a minor worry or expressing a need clearly. Pay attention to what happens in your body and mind during these moments. Journaling about these experiences can be very helpful.\n\nIt's important to note that while these strategies are a good beginning, patterns like these are often deeply rooted. Working with a licensed therapist can provide a safe, consistent space to understand these barriers, heal the wounds that built them, and practice new ways of connecting at a pace that feels manageable for you.

Many people experience this struggle—the desire for connection can feel at odds with a powerful instinct to protect ourselves by pulling away. That internal conflict can be incredibly draining and lonely.\n\nWhat you're describing often stems from a place of self-protection. Sometimes, past experiences teach us that closeness can lead to hurt, so we preemptively create distance to feel safe. The first step is simply bringing compassionate curiosity to this pattern, without judgment. When you feel the urge to isolate, can you pause and ask yourself, \"What am I feeling right now? What am I afraid might happen if I let this person in a little more?\"\n\nIn terms of practical steps, I often suggest starting very small. Choose one low-stakes relationship and practice one small act of vulnerability. This could be sharing a minor worry, accepting an invitation you'd normally decline, or simply telling someone you enjoyed their company. It's like building a muscle—start with light weights. Additionally, paying attention to your self-talk is crucial. If you notice critical inner dialogue about being a burden or assuming others will reject you, practice gently challenging those thoughts with more balanced statements.\n\nPlease remember that this pattern often has deep roots, and there is no need to navigate it alone.

As a babysitter, your scope is to implement strategies in collaboration with her parents. The most effective plan will come from you and her parents working as a team. I encourage you to share these ideas with them and create a consistent goodbye routine.\n\nPractically, structure and predictability are key. Work with her parents to establish a short, sweet, and identical goodbye ritual. This could be a special handshake, two hugs and a high-five, or a reassuring phrase like, \"I love you, I'll be back after work.\" The parents should avoid lingering or coming back after the goodbye, as this can increase anxiety. You can then immediately engage her in a highly preferred, calming activity that she only does with you—perhaps reading a specific book, playing with a special toy, or helping you prepare a snack. The goal is to pivot her attention to the positive routine with you.\n\nIf these meltdowns are extremely intense, prolonged, or if the parents have concerns about anxiety in other settings, it would be appropriate for them to consult with her pediatrician or a child therapist.

When children are in a state of partial arousal—like just waking from a nap or recovering from a bad dream—their emotional brain takes over. In that groggy, distressed state, their primary attachment figure (his mom) is their ultimate source of safety and comfort. It's not a rejection of you, but a powerful, instinctual drive for the person he associates with core security. The fact that he reconnects with you later, when fully awake and regulated, is a strong sign of the secure and loving bond you share.\n\nIn the moment, the most supportive response is to calmly and warmly honor his request. You might say, \"I hear you, you want Mommy right now. That's okay. I'll stay right here while we get her.\" This validates his feelings without taking his push-away personally. Stay present and calm, providing a quiet, safe space until his mom can take over. Your steady, unflustered presence, even from a slight distance, is still a form of comfort. Avoid expressing disappointment or trying to persuade him to accept your comfort, as this can increase his distress.\n\nYou are providing him with a wonderful secondary attachment figure—a safe adult who respects his boundaries and emotional needs.

It's understandable that you feel down all the time—anyone in your situation would be struggling.\n\nSince you don't have a depression diagnosis, it's very wise to pay attention to these feelings. What you're describing—persistent low mood due to ongoing stress—is significant and deserves support. While I can offer guidance here, connecting with a mental health professional, like a therapist or counselor, could provide you with a dedicated, confidential space to process this and build resilience. They can also help assess if what you're experiencing meets the criteria for depression, which is a treatable condition.\n\nOn a practical level, when school staff are unresponsive, it's important to document everything. Write down dates, times, what happened, and who was involved. Then, take this documentation to an adult you *do* trust—a parent, guardian, relative, or even a different staff member like a school nurse or coach. Ask them to help you advocate. Sometimes, putting a complaint in writing to the principal or school district superintendent can trigger a formal response. Your safety is the priority; if you ever feel physically threatened, do not hesitate to tell a trusted adult immediately or contact emergency services.\n\nPlease remember, this is not your fault.

Please continue to provide a safe, loving space at home where their feelings are believed and validated. Encourage them to share specifics with you—times, places, and what was said or done—as this documentation is crucial.\n\nSince the teacher's response has been ineffective, it is time to formally escalate the issue within the school system. I recommend requesting a meeting with the school principal or vice-principal. Prepare for this meeting by bringing your documented notes, any evidence you have, and a clear, calm statement about the impact on your child's mental health and education. Frame the conversation around the school's anti-bullying policy and your shared goal of ensuring a safe learning environment. Ask for a concrete action plan and a timeline for follow-up.\n\nIf the school administration is also unresponsive, you have the right to contact the district superintendent or the school board. In parallel, please consider seeking support from a child therapist. Bullying can have profound effects on self-esteem and mental health, and a professional can provide your child with coping tools and a confidential space to heal. You are your child's most important advocate. This is a heavy burden, but by taking these structured steps, you are moving from feeling powerless to actively championing your child's right to safety and respect.", "topic": "children-adolescents", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00851"}
{"id": "counsel_00949_aug_0", "question": "My spouse is deployed and my dependent ID was lost. I have a medical appointment on post tomorrow but can't access the base without it. What steps can I take to get a replacement and keep my appointment?", "answer": "First, I want to acknowledge how stressful this situation must be. Managing everything on the home front during a deployment is a huge responsibility, and a lost ID on top of that, especially with a time-sensitive medical appointment, is understandably overwhelming. Please take a deep breath. This is a common administrative hurdle, and there are clear steps to resolve it.\n\nYour immediate priority is accessing the base tomorrow. Here is your practical plan of action:\n\n1.  **Contact the Pass and ID Office Immediately:** Call the visitor control center or the installation's Pass and ID office **first thing in the morning**. Explain your situation—that you are a dependent with a lost ID and a scheduled medical appointment. They are the absolute authority on base access and replacement procedures. They can often issue a temporary pass or provide specific guidance for your situation.\n2.  **Gather Your Documents Tonight:** Locate **two forms of identification**, one of which must be a government-issued photo ID (like a driver's license). Your social security card, birth certificate, marriage certificate, and any copies of your lost ID or your spouse's orders are also extremely helpful. Having these ready will speed up the process.\n3.  **Call Your Clinic:** Reach out to your medical clinic's appointment line or patient advocate. Inform them of the access issue. They may be able to offer flexibility with your appointment time or provide guidance, as they frequently work with families in similar circumstances.\n\nRemember, you are not alone in this. Your unit's Family Readiness Group (FRG) leader or your spouse’s rear detachment command are also excellent resources for support and can sometimes help facilitate contact with the right offices. This is a logistical problem with a solution, not a reflection of your capability. You're doing a great job navigating a challenging time. Please reach out if you continue to feel overwhelmed; military OneSource is also available 24/7 for non-medical counseling and guidance at 1-800-342-9647.", "topic": "military-issues", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00852"}

My partner is away for training, and I don't know how to get onto the installation for my therapy session. Who can help me in this situation?", "answer": "First, I want to acknowledge how incredibly stressful and overwhelming this situation must feel. It's completely understandable to be upset—not only have you experienced a violation with your purse being taken, but you're also navigating this alone while your partner is away. The added pressure of potentially missing your therapy session, which is a crucial source of support, makes this even harder. Please know that your feelings are valid, and this is a lot to handle.\n\nYou are not without options, and there are people whose job it is to help in exactly these situations. Your immediate point of contact should be your installation's **Visitor Control Center (VCC)** or the **Pass and ID Office**. Call them directly. Explain that you are a military dependent, your spouse is away for training, and all your identification was stolen. They have procedures for this. They will likely ask for specific information to verify your identity and your spouse's service, such as your spouse's full name, date of birth, Social Security Number, and unit information. Having a copy of your marriage certificate or your spouse's military orders (if you have them digitally or can access them via email) will be immensely helpful.\n\nIn the meantime, I strongly encourage you to contact your therapist's office. Explain the situation and ask if they can conduct your session via telephone or a secure video platform. This is a common and reasonable accommodation, especially given the circumstances. It's important to maintain that continuity of care.\n\nAlso, please remember to file a police report for the stolen purse, as this is a necessary step for replacing your IDs and may be required by the Pass and ID office. If you're feeling isolated or panicked, you can also reach out to your unit's **Family Readiness Group (FRG) leader** or the **Military and Family Life Counseling (MFLC) program** for additional, immediate support. You are part of a community, and it's okay to lean on it right now. Let's focus on these practical steps first, and we can process the emotional impact more in your next session.

{"id": "counsel_00950_aug_0", "question": "I've been struggling with intrusive thoughts that just pop into my head, telling me I'm a failure. Even though I know they're my thoughts, they feel foreign and hostile. What could this be, and what can I do to quiet this internal critic?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes courage to articulate such a painful and confusing experience. What you're describing—these intrusive, hostile thoughts that feel both familiar and foreign—sounds incredibly distressing and isolating. Please know that your feelings are valid, and this is a challenge many people face, though it can feel uniquely personal when it's happening to you.\n\nWhile I cannot provide a diagnosis here, what you're describing can be associated with several conditions, such as anxiety disorders, depression, or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), where intrusive, self-critical thoughts are common. The key feature is the *intrusive* and *ego-dystonic* nature of the thoughts—meaning they feel at odds with your true self and values, which explains why they feel so hostile and foreign.\n\nThe most important step is to consult with a mental health professional, such as a therapist or psychologist, for a proper assessment. They can provide a safe space to explore these thoughts, determine an accurate diagnosis if applicable, and create a tailored treatment plan. Effective treatments like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) are excellent for learning to relate to these thoughts differently.\n\nIn the meantime, here are a couple of practical strategies:\n1.  **Name and Normalize:** Try gently labeling the thought as it arises: \"Ah, there's the 'failure' story again.\" This creates a small but crucial distance between you and the thought.\n2.  **Practice Self-Compassion:** When the critic is loud, see if you can respond with a kinder, more factual statement to yourself, as you might to a friend. For example, \"I'm having a thought that I'm a failure, but I know I am trying my best in a difficult moment.\"\n\nYour awareness of this pattern is a powerful first step toward change. With professional support, you can learn to quiet the critic and reconnect with your own, more compassionate voice.

What you're describing sounds incredibly distressing, and it takes courage to reach out and put words to this experience. It's completely understandable to feel unsettled when your own mind seems to generate such harsh and persistent criticism. Many people struggle with similar intrusive thoughts, and you are not alone in this.\n\nWhat you're experiencing could be related to several things, such as anxiety, depression, or patterns of negative self-talk that have become deeply ingrained. The feeling of it being a \"separate voice\" is a powerful metaphor that highlights how disconnected these thoughts can feel from your core self. While I can offer some general guidance, it's important to understand that as a counselor, I cannot provide a specific diagnosis in this format. A licensed professional working with you one-on-one could conduct a thorough assessment to understand the full context of your experience, which is the safest and most effective path forward.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some strategies you can practice. First, try to gently name what is happening: \"I'm having the thought that I'm not good enough.\" This creates a small but crucial distance between you and the thought. You might also practice grounding techniques, like focusing on your breath or the physical sensations in your feet on the floor, when the thoughts feel overwhelming. Journaling can help externalize these thoughts, and challenging them with evidence—listing times you *were* \"good enough\"—can slowly weaken their power.\n\nYour safety and well-being are paramount. If these thoughts ever escalate to include ideas of harming yourself or others, please reach out to a crisis line or seek immediate support. I strongly encourage you to connect with a therapist.

{"id": "counsel_00951_aug_0", "question": "I'm trying to understand how mental health professionals actually determine someone's personality style. Could you explain the process and the key traits they focus on during an assessment?", "answer": "Thank you for asking such an insightful question. It's completely understandable to want to understand how professionals approach something as complex as personality. Seeking clarity shows a real commitment to your own self-awareness, and that's a significant strength.\n\nThe process of understanding personality style is typically comprehensive and multi-faceted. It's rarely about focusing on a single trait. Instead, we aim to see the whole picture. The assessment usually involves a **clinical interview**, where we discuss your life history, relationships, work, and how you typically think, feel, and behave across different situations. We listen for enduring patterns that have been consistent over time and across settings.\n\nWe often focus on key areas like how you relate to others and yourself, your emotional regulation, your impulse control, and your core coping mechanisms. We might explore traits related to empathy, flexibility, perfectionism, or need for approval, always considering how these patterns impact your daily functioning and well-being. Many professionals use structured assessment tools or questionnaires to supplement the interview, but these are guides, not definitive labels.\n\nIt's important to remember that a formal personality assessment is a nuanced process that requires professional training. While self-reflection is valuable, a licensed clinician can provide a balanced, contextual understanding that self-tests cannot. If you're considering a formal assessment, I encourage you to seek a consultation with a psychologist or therapist. They can walk you through their specific process, ensuring it's collaborative and focused on understanding you as a unique individual, not just a set of traits.

What's the framework they use to categorize these traits in a real therapy setting?", "answer": "Thank you for asking such an insightful question. It's clear you care deeply about your friend and want to understand their experience better. It's completely natural to feel curious, and even a little concerned, when someone close to us receives a new perspective on their mental health.\n\nIn a clinical setting, diagnosing a personality structure is a careful and nuanced process, not a quick label. While you may have heard of frameworks like the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), which lists specific criteria, the actual process is more comprehensive. A clinician typically gathers information across multiple sessions, looking at long-standing patterns in thinking, emotion, behavior, and interpersonal relationships that cause significant distress or impairment. They listen for themes in how the person perceives themselves, others, and the world. This is often combined with clinical observation of how the client relates *within the therapy session itself*.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that a diagnosis is not a definition of a person, but a tool to guide treatment toward the most effective strategies for healing and growth. The most important part of the framework is the collaborative understanding built between the therapist and your friend.\n\nBecause I am not your friend's therapist and lack their full history and consent, I cannot speak to their specific situation. The best way to support your friend is with empathy, free of judgment. You might simply let them know you're there to listen if they ever want to talk about their therapy journey.

It's exhausting and affects my daily life. I've read about something called 'somatic empathy,' but I'm not sure if that's a real diagnosis or what to do about it. Could this be a recognized condition?", "answer": "Thank you for sharing this with me. What you're describing sounds incredibly challenging and exhausting. It takes a great deal of self-awareness to recognize how deeply you're affected by the emotions of others and to seek understanding. Your experience is very real, and the fatigue and impact on your daily life are completely valid.\n\nWhat you're referring to—often called somatic empathy or empathic receptivity—is indeed a recognized and studied psychological experience. It describes the phenomenon of not just understanding someone's feelings cognitively, but physically sensing them in your own body. While it is not a standalone clinical diagnosis in manuals like the DSM-5, it is a very real trait that can be a significant feature of several recognized conditions. For instance, it can be associated with high sensory processing sensitivity (HSP), anxiety disorders, or be a factor in situations of burnout or compassion fatigue. The crucial part, which you've already identified, is that it's causing you distress and interfering with your life.\n\nBecause this experience can be linked to various underlying factors, I would gently encourage you to seek a consultation with a licensed mental health professional. A therapist can provide a safe space to explore your unique experience, help determine if it connects to a specific diagnosis, and—most importantly—work with you to develop personalized coping strategies. In the meantime, you might explore grounding techniques, like mindful breathing when you feel overwhelmed, or setting gentle boundaries to create emotional space. Practices that strengthen your sense of self, such as journaling about which feelings are yours versus others', can also be helpful.\n\nYou are not alone in this.

What you're describing sounds incredibly challenging and deeply impactful on both your relationship and your personal well-being. It takes a lot of self-awareness to recognize this dynamic, and I want to validate that your experience of feeling others' stress and physical sensations so intensely is very real and can be exhausting.\n\nTo answer your specific question: while the term \"empath\" is not a formal clinical diagnosis, the experience you're describing is well-recogned in mental health fields. It often relates to traits of high sensory processing sensitivity and profound empathy, which can be innate strengths. However, when it leads to significant distress or impairment—as it seems to be doing for you—it can overlap with clinically relevant concepts. For instance, it may be explored in the context of anxiety, conditions related to emotional regulation, or even somatic symptom experiences. A qualified mental health professional can help you understand these nuances through a thorough assessment, which is an important next step.\n\nWhat's most crucial right now is developing strategies to manage this absorption. I strongly encourage you to seek a consultation with a therapist. They can help you build essential skills, such as grounding techniques to distinguish your own emotions from others', setting healthy emotional boundaries, and practicing self-compassion. In the short term, you might try a simple mindfulness exercise: when you feel this absorption happening, pause and consciously check in with your own body, asking, \"What here is *mine*?\" This can begin the process of separation.\n\nYou are not alone in this experience, and with support, you can learn to navigate this sensitivity in a way that protects your well-being and enriches your relationships.", "topic": "diagnosis", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00855"}

Starting therapy is a significant step, and wondering about the fit shows you're invested in getting the most out of the process. It's your time, your journey, and finding the right guide is essential.\n\nThere are several positive signs that your therapist understands you.

Over time, you should feel a growing sense of collaboration—like you're working *with* them. A good fit often includes moments where they offer an insight or perspective that resonates deeply, even if it's challenging. Fundamentally, you should feel safe and increasingly able to be open.\n\nYou are absolutely within your rights to guide the process. I encourage you to view this as part of the therapy itself. You can say things like, \"I think it would help me most if we focus more on...\" or \"When I talk about [topic], what I really need is help with...\" You can also be direct: \"To feel more supported, I think I need more practical strategies,\" or \"I need more space just to vent.\" A skilled therapist will welcome this feedback as crucial information to better help you.\n\nIf, after several sessions and open communication, you still feel consistently misunderstood, dismissed, or stagnant, it may be worth discussing your concerns about the fit directly or considering a consultation with another therapist.

Taking this step to seek help is significant, and wanting to ensure it's a good fit shows you are invested in your own well-being, which is a great starting point.\n\nYou've touched on two key parts: knowing if a therapist is right for you, and communicating your needs. First, a \"right fit\" often involves both professional competence and personal comfort. You should feel that your therapist is genuinely listening, understands your perspective without immediate judgment, and creates a space where you feel safe to be open. Pay attention to how you feel during and after sessions. Do you feel heard and respected, even when challenged? Do their theoretical approach and style seem compatible with how you process things? Trusting your intuition here is valid.\n\nTo effectively communicate your needs, I encourage you to be as direct as possible, even from the first session. You might say, \"My primary goal for therapy is to work on X. I believe I will benefit from Y type of approach or support.\" A skilled therapist will welcome this clarity and will collaborate with you to create a treatment plan. It's also perfectly okay to check in periodically and say, \"I'd like to revisit my goals to make sure we're still aligned.\" This is your time and your process.\n\nRemember, the therapeutic relationship is a partnership. It's okay if it takes a session or two to gauge the fit, and it's also okay to discuss any doubts about the process with your therapist.

It is completely understandable to worry about what is \"appropriate\" when you're in such a personal and emotionally charged space. Please know that your feelings are important and welcome here.\n\nWhat you're describing is not only common, but it is a very natural and human response to the work of therapy. Crying in a session is an experience shared by countless clients. Therapy is one of the few places designed specifically to process deep, difficult, or painful emotions that we often have to hold back in our daily lives. When you feel safe enough to let those feelings surface, tears are a normal and healthy expression of that release. They are a signal that you are engaging authentically with your material, and from a therapeutic perspective, they can be an important part of the healing process.\n\nI encourage you to bring this worry itself into your next session. Sharing your concern about being emotional with your therapist can be a powerful step. It opens up a conversation about your experience of safety, your relationship with vulnerability, and any fears you might have about being judged. A good therapist will help you navigate these feelings and will hold space for your emotions without judgment.

It’s completely understandable to wonder if therapy is truly effective or if it’s just conversation. Many people come to therapy with that same uncertainty, and it’s a valid concern when you’re considering investing your time, energy, and hope into the process.\n\nYou’re right that therapy involves talk, but it is a very specific and structured type of talk, fundamentally different from a chat with a friend. A trained therapist creates a safe, confidential space where you can explore thoughts and patterns without judgment. We use evidence-based frameworks to help you understand the roots of your distress, develop new coping strategies, and literally reshape unhelpful neural pathways.

However, it's important to understand that these changes are often the result of a collaborative process, not just the act of talking itself. A counselor provides a safe, confidential space where you can explore your thoughts and feelings without judgment.

This process can lead to tangible outcomes like reduced anxiety, improved communication in relationships, better emotional regulation, and clearer decision-making.\n\nIt's also fair to acknowledge that counseling isn't a magic cure. Its effectiveness depends on factors like the fit between you and your counselor, your readiness to engage in the process, and the nature of the challenges you're facing.

{"id": "counsel_00957_aug_0", "question": "What are the initial steps a therapist takes to guide the therapeutic process following an intake session?", "answer": "Thank you for asking this important question. It shows a real investment in understanding the therapeutic process, which is a wonderful first step toward your own growth and healing. It's completely normal to feel a bit uncertain about what comes next after an initial intake session, and I appreciate you reaching out for clarity.\n\nFollowing an intake, a therapist's primary goal is to build upon the foundation of trust and information you've just started creating together. The initial steps typically involve a thoughtful, collaborative process. First, we would synthesize the information from our intake to develop an initial understanding, or a \"case conceptualization.\" This isn't a fixed label, but rather a working map of your strengths, challenges, and the patterns in your life.\n\nMost importantly, we would work together to establish clear, collaborative goals for our work. This means we'd have a conversation about what *you* hope to achieve in therapy—whether it's reducing anxiety, improving relationships, or processing a specific event. These goals become our shared compass. We would also discuss and agree upon the practical framework of our work: the frequency of sessions, our methods of communication between sessions, confidentiality, and what you can expect from me as your therapist.\n\nThis early phase is about ensuring you feel heard, safe, and oriented. My role is to guide this process with you, not for you. If at any point the concerns you've shared indicate an immediate risk to your safety or the safety of others, that would become our absolute and immediate priority to address with a concrete plan.\n\nRemember, beginning therapy is a courageous act. Please be patient with yourself as this relationship and process unfold. I am here to walk with you through these initial steps and beyond.", "topic": "counseling-fundamentals", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00860"}
{"id": "counsel_00957_aug_1", "question": "Following an initial consultation, what structured approach does a mental health professional use to establish the course of treatment?", "answer": "Thank you for asking this important question. It shows a thoughtful approach to understanding the therapeutic process, which can help build trust and confidence as you begin this journey. It's completely normal to wonder what happens after that first meeting and how a path forward is created.\n\nFollowing an initial consultation, a licensed mental health professional typically uses a structured, collaborative approach to establish a treatment course. This often begins with a comprehensive assessment, where we synthesize the information gathered about your history, current challenges, strengths, and goals. From this, we formulate a working understanding of your concerns—not just a diagnosis, but a holistic view of your situation.\n\nThe cornerstone of establishing treatment is developing a **treatment plan**. This is a collaborative document we create together. It outlines specific, measurable goals (what you want to change), the proposed methods or interventions (such as CBT, mindfulness, etc.), and a preliminary timeline. This plan serves as our roadmap, ensuring our work is focused and effective. It’s also a living document; we will check in regularly to assess progress and adjust the plan as needed.\n\nMy role is to guide this process with expertise, but you are the expert on your own life. Our work will be a partnership. If at any point the concerns you bring forward involve immediate risk to your safety or the safety of others, that becomes our absolute priority, and we will discuss and implement a safety plan directly.\n\nPlease know that taking this step to seek clarity is a significant part of the process itself.

{"id": "counsel_00958_aug_0", "question": "What core competencies should an effective therapist possess?", "answer": "Thank you for asking such an important question. It shows a real commitment to understanding what makes therapy a safe and effective space, whether you're considering this field or reflecting on your own therapeutic journey. It's completely normal to wonder what qualities create a foundation of trust and growth in the counseling relationship.\n\nAn effective therapist integrates several core competencies that work together. Fundamentally, these include a deep capacity for **empathy and unconditional positive regard**—the ability to understand your world without judgment and to consistently value you as a person. Coupled with this is **active listening**, which means truly hearing not just your words, but the emotions and meanings behind them.\n\nProfessionally, a competent therapist must have a strong **ethical foundation**, upholding confidentiality and clear professional boundaries to ensure your safety and autonomy. **Cultural humility** is essential—a commitment to understanding your unique background, identity, and worldview without imposing their own. Furthermore, effective therapists utilize **case conceptualization** to understand your concerns in context, and they are skilled in **evidence-based interventions**, applying techniques that are known to be helpful for your specific challenges.\n\nIt's also crucial that a therapist engages in **ongoing self-reflection and supervision**. This means they continually examine their own biases and reactions to provide you with the best care possible. Remember, the presence of a strong, collaborative alliance between you and your therapist is one of the most significant factors in positive outcomes. If you are seeking a therapist, I encourage you to consider these competencies and trust your feelings about whether you feel heard, respected, and safe with a potential provider.", "topic": "counseling-fundamentals", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00861"}
{"id": "counsel_00958_aug_1", "question": "What are the essential qualities and abilities needed for successful counseling practice?", "answer": "Thank you for asking such an important and foundational question. It shows you are thoughtfully considering what it takes to be truly effective in this role, which is a wonderful starting point.\n\nAt its heart, successful counseling is built on a core set of personal qualities and professional abilities. The essential qualities include **genuine empathy**—the capacity to understand and feel your client’s world without judgment—and **unconditional positive regard**, which means valuing the client as a person regardless of their circumstances. Coupled with this is **congruence**, or authenticity, where you are real and transparent within the therapeutic relationship.\n\nProfessionally, critical abilities include **active listening**—hearing not just the words but the meanings and emotions behind them—and **effective communication** to reflect and clarify. **Cultural humility** is indispensable; it’s the commitment to understanding your own biases and respectfully learning about a client’s unique background. Furthermore, strong **ethical reasoning** and the ability to maintain clear, healthy boundaries are non-negotiable for creating a safe, trustworthy environment.\n\nIt’s also vital to recognize that these skills are developed over a lifetime of practice, supervision, and self-reflection. A key ability is knowing your own limits and when to seek consultation or refer a client to a more specialized professional. This protects both you and those you serve.\n\nRemember, cultivating these qualities is a journey. Engaging in your own personal growth, seeking quality training and supervision, and practicing consistent self-care are the ways these essentials become integrated into your practice. You are asking the right questions to begin that journey well.", "topic": "counseling-fundamentals", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00861"}
{"id": "counsel_00959_aug_0", "question": "What challenges might a therapist face when working with a client in a therapeutic setting?", "answer": "Thank you for asking such an important and thoughtful question. It shows a real depth of consideration for the therapeutic process, whether you're exploring this from the perspective of a future therapist or a current client. Acknowledging these challenges is a crucial step in navigating them effectively.\n\nYou're right to recognize that this work, while deeply rewarding, comes with its own set of complexities. Therapists often face challenges like managing their own emotional reactions (countertransference) to a client's story, navigating moments of therapeutic impasse where progress feels stalled, and maintaining professional boundaries while building a genuine, trusting connection. There's also the weight of ethical decision-making and the risk of compassion fatigue or burnout from consistently holding space for others' pain.\n\nIt's essential for therapists to have their own support systems and professional safeguards in place to meet these challenges. This includes regular clinical supervision, ongoing personal therapy, and a commitment to self-care. These aren't signs of weakness but are fundamental to ethical and sustainable practice. They ensure the therapist can remain fully present, objective, and emotionally available for their clients.\n\nIf you are a therapist or trainee grappling with these feelings, I gently encourage you to bring these very questions to your supervisor. If you are a client concerned about your therapist's ability to hold your story, know that your therapist's professional responsibility is to manage their own process so they can be fully there for you. Your role is to be as open as you can be; their role is to create a safe, contained space for that openness. This partnership, built on trust and professional integrity, is how we work through challenges together.", "topic": "counseling-fundamentals", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00862"}
{"id": "counsel_00959_aug_1", "question": "In a counseling relationship, what are some common obstacles a mental health professional could experience?", "answer": "Thank you for asking such an important question. It shows a great deal of self-awareness and professional commitment to be thinking about the challenges inherent in the counseling relationship. It's completely normal and expected for mental health professionals to encounter obstacles in their work—it's a deeply human process, and navigating human dynamics is complex.\n\nSome common obstacles include managing **transference and countertransference**, where a client's feelings about significant people in their life get directed toward you, or where your own personal experiences are triggered by a client's material. This requires constant self-reflection and supervision. **Establishing and maintaining clear boundaries** is another frequent challenge, whether it's around time, communication outside sessions, or the appropriate level of self-disclosure. Professionals may also face **compassion fatigue or burnout** from consistently holding space for others' pain, which can lead to emotional exhaustion if not managed.\n\nTo navigate these obstacles, I strongly encourage a proactive approach. Regular **clinical supervision or consultation** is not just beneficial; it's essential for ethical practice. It provides a safe space to process these challenges. Prioritizing your own **self-care and personal therapy** is equally critical—you cannot pour from an empty cup. Furthermore, continually engaging in **professional development** can help you feel more equipped and confident when these obstacles arise.\n\nRemember, encountering these hurdles doesn't mean you're failing; it means you're engaged in the real, demanding, and rewarding work of counseling. By acknowledging them and utilizing your support systems, you protect both your well-being and the integrity of the therapeutic relationship. Please reach out to a trusted supervisor or colleague if you're currently facing a specific challenge—you don't have to navigate this alone.", "topic": "counseling-fundamentals", "source": "augmented", "original_id": "counsel_00862"}
